It’s become a nightly ritual for us.</p><p>I’ll watch him turn on COD around 8:33 pm and consequently wonder if anyone is watching me and writing about it on the internet.</p><p>He just got a kill.</p><p>I’m also toggling back and forth between this page and the Thursday night football game.</p><p>I bet on the Falcons, and their deficit seems to increase every time I check. Down 13-0 at the moment.</p><p>I just remembered what I wanted to talk to you about today. This idea came to me in the shower a few hours ago while I was thinking about one of the happiest periods of my life.</p><p>It was around February to May 2021. I’d finally started making money online. Those first $3k, $5k, and $10k months were unforgettable.</p><p>I was on top of the world. After all this time, I finally proved I could do it.</p><p>But when I think back to those times, most of the highlights aren’t sexy.</p><p>They’re the little moments of gratitude. Or the normally mundane mornings that I’ve colored with a nostalgic hue.</p><p>I remember walking on the stair stepper at my college gym, wearing a ripped blue t-shirt, smiling like an idiot while typing away Tweets on the keyboard.</p><p>It was my first $6k month, and I was rich. Not literally, but I would’ve been if wealth were measured in gratitude.</p><p>There’s a collection of other minuscule moments I won’t bore you with a story behind, but this idea in and of itself is interesting.</p><p>You probably have this grand vision for where you’d like to be in 6 months, a year, five years… but the scenes you imagine now probably won’t be what you appreciate when you get there.</p><p>You’ll have fond memories of the beautiful blonde in the passenger seat of your Porsche 911, but the one that stands out isn’t picture-perfect.</p><p>It’s the late-night fast food run where she spills her frosty on the seat, and you rip the t-shirt off your back to wipe it off before it seeps into the leather.</p><p>It’s when you drop your potatoes and run out of the grocery store to your desk because you just had an idea that must be acted upon immediately.</p><p>I don’t know if any of this made sense, but if you’re still reading this far along we’re probably on the same page (figuratively).</p><p>It looks like my Call Of Duty-loving neighbor just called it a night and that’s my sign to do the same.</p><p>Day 1 is down; 99 more to go.</p><p>We’ll chat tomorrow if I don’t forget.</p><p>- Ben</p></div>",

All of the buildings are lit up. My across-the-sky neighbor is enjoying the show with his girl.</p><p>It’s not the COD-playing neighbor I wrote about in 001. I don’t think he has many friends. The dude on the floor above him is my homie, Clarence.</p><p>We’ve never spoken, but he looks like his name is Clarence.</p><p>We wave to each other while drinking morning coffee on our parallel balconies.</p><p>I think he’s in ecom because he works on his laptop and I saw him taking product pics one time.</p><p>Anyway, I wish you guys could see the view right now.</p><p>I’d take a picture for you, but “some moments are best kept as memories.”</p><p>A girl told me that while we were drinking wine on the beach looking up at the stars.</p><p>I’m not sure if it was profound or if I just wanted to smash. She had pretty eyes.</p><p>It’s a Saturday night and I’m leaning toward staying in.</p><p>Many of my favorite nights are spent at my laptop with a ninety-dollar Diptyque candle on my desk. I’m either planning a road to $100 mil or gambling away my life savings at the roulette table. Never an in-between.</p><p>Life’s too short to half-ass anything. But most people half-ass the entire thing.</p><p>It’s easy to do when you were raised like me. Good family and never had to stress about food on the table, or bills being paid.</p><p>Sounds like a pretty good upbringing, no?</p><p>It is, but often times it leads to a mediocre life.</p><p>Everything is too convenient. It’s easy to get a decent job and climb the corporate ladder.</p><p>Why push for more?</p><p>Just play it safe and you’ll never have to struggle.</p><p>Easy times create weak men and weak men cut off their balls and dye their hair pink… or however the saying goes.</p><p>To me, the most miserable existence of all is one where you never push all your chips to the middle.</p><p>You never get to find out what you’re capable of when your back is against the wall.</p><p>I’d rather lose everything than never try.</p><p>You test yourself as a man. And like a sword, you come through the fire sharper than you were before.</p><p>Run towards the things that scare you. The more resistance you feel, the more it means you need to do it.</p><p>Unless you’re scared of fat bitches because I am too and I’m RUNNING away like the wind.</p><p>I got stuck walking behind one today for 22.4 seconds. The longest 22.4 seconds of my life.</p><p>This email just took a turn and if I keep going down this route I might end up in handcuffs.</p><p>I’ll leave you with a quote from a movie that changed my life, Fight Club. <em>eye-roll</em></p><p>“I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who’ve ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s**t we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War’s a spiritual war… our Great Depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.”</p><p>Thanks for reading today’s scatterbrained rant.</p><p>Chat tomorrow fellow space monkey,</p><p>Ben</p></div>",

I have a science test second period.&quot; I&#x27;d frantically remember.</p><p>It was one of those classes where I couldn&#x27;t even tell you what the test was about. </p><p>I was just hoping that the Asian girl to my right would write big enough so I could copy her again. She got me an 84 on the last one. I think her name is Sarah, but I&#x27;m not sure.</p><p>That&#x27;s how it went for all four years of high school.</p><p>The week was spent looking forward to the weekend, and the weekend was spent dreading the following week.</p><p>That&#x27;s where I grew such a strong aversion to living on someone else&#x27;s clock and taking orders.</p><p>&quot;Can I go to the bathroom? Turns into &quot;Can I get a week off?&quot;</p><p>No. Thank. You.</p><p>I prefer to be in control of my own urination cycle and time.</p><p>Switching gears, I just did my laundry, and it gave me an idea.</p><p>&quot;Partimegirlfriend.com&quot;</p><p>How cool would that be?</p><p>You log in to an online portal, pick the one you want and click confirm.</p><p>Seven seconds later, Jenny spawns from thin air, eager to do the dishes and fold your clothes.</p><p>You can take her out to dinner, go on put-put dates, or even introduce her to your Grandma.</p><p>But when you want to be alone, you just click a button, and she vanishes.</p><p>It&#x27;s basically <a href=\"https://www.tryclosify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Closify</a> but for companionship.</p><p>You get all the benefits of having a girlfriend without the responsibility; A true win-win.</p><p>And no, it&#x27;s not the same as ordering a hooker.

I was in a Honda Civic. He was in a yellow Ferrari Pista. Safe to say I didn&#x27;t win.</p><p>Ok, back to the story.</p><p>A lot of the book is just motivation porn, but for a 13-year-old with big dreams, it was my bible.</p><p>In retrospect, one of the book&#x27;s last lines made a lasting impact on me.</p><p>&quot;Every dream you imagine, everything you see and hear and feel in your sleep, that&#x27;s not a fantasy, that&#x27;s your deep instinct telling you it can be all real. Follow those visions and dreams and desires and believe what you know. Only you can turn those dreams into reality. Never stop until you do.&quot;</p><p>Gives me the chills to this day.</p><p>When you ask a 9-year-old kid what they want to be when they grow up, they don&#x27;t say investment banker. They don&#x27;t say accountant. They don&#x27;t say waiter. They don&#x27;t say only fans model.</p><p>But 12 years later, whatever goals they had have been beaten out of them.</p><p>Makes me sad just talking about it, so I&#x27;m changing the topic.</p><p>Today I learned that one of my (formerly) favorite gurus is kind of a scammer.</p><p>Not a full scammer… he didn&#x27;t hire an army of college kids to hand out fake parking tickets, set up a &quot;website&quot; where people go to pay, steal their card info and sell it on the black market.</p><p>I had that idea after I got a parking ticket once. It&#x27;s genius.</p><p>Anyway, I watched this guy&#x27;s Youtube videos in college and took a full 2-3 pages worth of notes on each video.</p><p>I planned on going to his live events and maybe investing in his coaching one day.</p><p>And today, I found out he sucks at his job.</p><p>Want me to tell you who?</p><p>You&#x27;re probably on the edge of your seat right now.</p><p>Let me tell you how I learned this. </p><p>I was talking to a guy today who has over 450k followers on tik tok. He&#x27;s in the dating niche, his content is good, and anyone in that position should be able to make AT LEAST $20k a month.</p><p>Like bare minimum. Seriously.</p><p>He&#x27;s working with [redacted], who told him to make an 8-week coaching program and sell it entirely through the DM&#x27;s. No sales calls.</p><p>The course is only $300 and this poor guy is lucky when he gets more than 2 sales a month.</p><p>Here&#x27;s the worst part…</p><p>[redacted] is charging him $2,500 a month for CONSULTING.</p><p>The anonymous brain-dead monkey accounts on Twitter could help this guy more than [redacted] is.</p><p>U N R E A L</p><p>If you&#x27;re still reading, reply with a guess of who you think the guru is, and I&#x27;ll tell you if you&#x27;re right or wrong.</p><p>My eyes are getting tired and you&#x27;re probably tired of reading the word [redacted] so I think we should end this.</p><p>I have to sneeze.</p><p>Much love,</p><p>Ben</p><p>​</p></div>",

He lives in Miami, has dope friends, makes money, travels, and builds cool shit (and he&#x27;s insanely fucking handsome).</p><p>But sometimes, on the inside, he feels like everything is crumbling…like he&#x27;s faking it all…He thinks others are passing him, he&#x27;ll never figure it out, and he bit off more than he can chew.</p><p>Maybe that&#x27;s why he hasn&#x27;t sent an email in 6 days – Because he doesn&#x27;t want them to know what he wants to say.</p><p>Whenever he opens his laptop, he stares at a blinking cursor on a blank screen. He knows what he wants to write when he puts his fingers on the keyboard. But those thoughts vanish to protect this illusion he portrays.</p><p>Now, this is all hypothetical, of course. I don&#x27;t want you to think I&#x27;M saying any of these things. </p><p>My life is actually perfect. And this journal entry will never actually see the light of day anyway.</p><p>So I guess I&#x27;ll start to wrap this up. Because I&#x27;ve got to write the email that I&#x27;m actually going to send today.</p><p>I&#x27;m glad we had this chat, though - just the two of us.</p><p>Just keep doing what you&#x27;re doing, bro. You&#x27;re on the right path… And you know no one really knows what they&#x27;re doing? They&#x27;re all just faking it too.</p><p>Think about how far you&#x27;ve come. In another world, you&#x27;re about to start looking for a $70k-a-year job out of college.</p><p>Be grateful for where you are.</p><p>Good talk.</p></div>",

I’ve gotten almost everything on my to-do list done already, and it’s only 10:15 am.</p><p>Who knew how much you could accomplish when you just sit down and work?</p><p>I’d been meditating naked while praying to my David Goggins poster for the last 2 years, thinking THAT would make me a millionaire.</p><p>Oh well, better later than never.</p><p>Wait, why are you looking at me like I impregnated your Grandma?</p><p>Do I have something on my fa– OHHH, you’re mad that I haven’t emailed you in months after telling you that I was gonna email you for 100 days straight.</p><p>Aaaand to make it worse, I’m carrying on like nothing ever happened. Talk about an elephant in the room.</p><p>This is probably how girlfriends feel when you do something they don’t like, but they don’t wanna tell you what it was.</p><p>You know somethings wrong, and you keep asking her, “bb, what’s wrong” and she says, “nothinngggg” but the tone gets angrier every time you ask.</p><p>And then, FINALLY she cracks and tells you what’s pissing her off.</p><p>Turns out she’s mad that you got her whole milk instead of oat milk in her iced latte… Yup, been there too man.</p><p>Ok, sorry I&#x27;m deflecting.</p><p>You see, what really happened is I’ve accidentally been sending to the wrong segment. So we’re actually on day 74 of the 100-day email challenge, and you just haven’t been getting the emails! Haha!</p><p>Ok, you’re right that’s BS. Stop looking at me like that… FINE! I committed to writing an email every day for 100 days, and I quit on day 9. I said it. Happy now?</p><p>A lot has changed since we last spoke.</p><p>First and most importantly, I got a Nespresso machine. I’m actually sitting on my balcony with a burnt tongue, still managing to sip down this latte.</p><p>Second, I bought a toy.</p><p>It’s black and german (pause).</p><p>Yes, I’m talking about an Audi RS5. And don’t forget the R or the S. Because that means racing sport. And it signifies that I’m better than all the other wagie cucks that drive around in A5s or S5s.</p><p>I didn’t really post it on Twitter (like everyone else when they get their first nice car) because I wanted to feel like I was better than everyone.</p><p>It sounds cooler to buy it and keep it private, right? Like, oh, not a big deal at all that I spent more money on a hunk of metal than what I would’ve made annually with a job out of college.</p><p>Not that that’s super impressive… I imagine most Communications majors from the College of Charleston end up dying their hair pink and making frappuccinos&#x27; for a living.</p><p>I’m buying another toy today too, actually. It’s a lot smaller and about 1/5th the price.</p><p>I’ll show you tomorrow on the rare chance that I actually send another email this quarter.</p><p>Anyone wanna take a side bet? Live odds for me sending an email tomorrow are about +800.</p><p>But hey, if you read all the way to here, hit reply and let me know. I thrive off validation from strangers behind a screen, and if enough of you [redacted] reply, maybe I’ll keep this train going.</p><p>GREAT catching up with you {{ subscriber.first_name }}.</p><p>Talk tomorrow for +800 :)</p><p>Ben<br/>​</p></div>",

But because I want your money.</p><p>All of these people that you see online are making a FUCK TON of money, and I’m only getting % of it.</p><p>I want the whole pie.</p><p>So I decided that I’m gonna start taking this newsletter more seriously and sell you some bullshit Dan Koe/ Dickie Bush style writing course.</p><p>Not to hate on either of them because they’re both great. And they’re really good at organizing notions.</p><p>Anyway, I worked with a guy recently who had a really hot assistant. It was clear she was only on the team because she was hot, but boy was that a great idea.</p><p>When you’re in the presence of an attractive female, everyone brings their A-Game. And it’s completely sub-conscious.</p><p>And just imagine being a client trying to fire me, and some bimbo barbie gets on the call and says, “noooo don’t go, John. I know we spent $104,000 last month and we only made you $2,400 back, but think about all the fun we’ve had. We’re meant to be.”</p><p>The original “client retention hack.” Not that any of your favorite Twitter dorks keep clients for longer than a few months anyway.</p><p>Oh yeah, back to my writing course.</p><p>I think the first module will be able how to write concisely, and never get sidetracked. Because CLEARLY, I’m very good at that.</p><p>Also Mason, if you’re reading this, don’t worry. It’s not gonna compete with <a href=\"https://www.copymba.com/freelancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><u>Copy MBA</u></a> (it’s gonna be way better).</p><p>But you, {{ subscriber.first_name }}, should go click that link and buy it because I get a %.</p><p>Didn’t think this email would turn into a promo for one of my friends&#x27; courses, but here we are.</p><p>On that note, time for me to ask chat GPT to tuck me in and read me a bedtime story because I’m calling it a night.</p><p>Live odds I email you tomorrow are +1100. Reply to put in your bet.</p><p>Night,</p><p>Ben</p></div>",

Pleasure to have you.</p><p>I’ll fill you in real quick.</p><p>On November 10th, 2022, I set out to write a daily email to my subscribers for 100 days straight.</p><p>Today marks day 116 in a row.</p><p>Crazy right?</p><p>I’ve written an email every day for the last 116 days, which is even more than I originally set out to do.

Or you end up drooling all over yourself.</p><p>But if you can get over that phase, the buzz is completely and utterly unmatched.</p><p>Imagine all of the lights in your brain just shutting off for a fleeting moment. It’s like you transport into the mind of a 20-year-old blonde sorority girl.</p><p>I’m telling you this because chops offer a perfect analogy for life.</p><p>The lows allow you to appreciate the highs (literally).</p><p>Look at child celebrities and kids that made it big in crypto.</p><p>Most of them go insane because they were handed everything too quickly. I’m sure it’s fun at the beginning, where you’re just able to fuck off for a bit.</p><p>But what happens when that kind of stuff gets old?</p><p>Surely nothing can give you the same kind of dopamine high that you get when you turn $1,000 into $10m on some meme coin of a dog.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Maybe I’m just jealous.</p><p>Anyway, I gotta go scam little kids on the internet.</p><p>Hit reply if you’re new here, and tell me your favorite color or something.</p><p>Talk soon,</p><p>Ben</p></div>",

I share results, and people come to me inbound.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I also get a lot of referrals and work with my close friends.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong><em>3. Since you can work from anywhere, why Miami?  Long-term to stay there or move somewhere else, or even buy a second home/apartment somewhere?</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">All of my friends are here. Good weather. Parents have a condo an hour and a half north. Great place to meet other young entrepreneurs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I&#x27;ll likely be in South Florida for a while… not sure how long it’ll be Miami.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Don’t think I’d get a second place any time soon unless it were necessary for biz, or I fall in love with some random girl that lives in bumble fuck Idaho or something lol.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong><em>4. If you were 19 years old and trying to get to $10-15k a month as quickly as possible, what would you do?</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If female: OnlyFans.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If male: Learn a high-value skill, pitch a fuck ton of people, get a client, repeat.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s really that simple.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Send enough cold messages, connect with enough people, and hack your way into different groups… you’ll find clients. You just gotta look hard enough.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong><em>5. When you think about yourself 10 years in the past or 50 years in the future, does that feel like “Ben at a different time” or “This is a totally different person”?</em></strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben at a different time.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I thought differently.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I operated differently.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I had a different self-identity.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But at the end of the day, the current me was in there all along.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Okay, enough writing.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There actually were a few other decent questions, but this email is already getting too long. So if I didn’t answer you, don’t take it to heart.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Blame your fellow subscribers, actually. They have the attention span of a gnat, so I know I’ll lose them if I keep rambling.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you guys liked this lmk, I’ll make this Q&amp;A a weekly thing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Love you {{ subscriber.first_name }},</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">P.S. I wrote a somewhat legible Twitter thread today. </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/benhbader/status/1661430306774155272?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Read it here.</span></strong></a><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></strong></p></div>",

    "content": "<style>.region div { padding: 0 !important; }</style><div class=\"spaced-contents\"><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">One day during my sophomore year of high school, I was talking about confidence with a teammate on my basketball team.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">His name is Colin, and he’s probably reading this email along with you.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">In that conversation, he said something that stuck with me to this day - hence the email.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’d asked him how he seemed so unbothered when he missed shots.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He replied, </span><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">“My confidence isn’t a rollercoaster.”</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Colin went on to become the all-time leading scorer at our school.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I was on a walk today thinking about this idea of unwavering confidence.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">As I write this email, I’m wrestling with where it comes from.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">We can all agree that a large part of confidence is derived from preparation – but it’s not that black and white.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I was </span><em><span style=\"font-size:18px\">obsessed</span></em><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> with basketball throughout high school.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I put in as many hours as anyone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But when I’d miss a few shots, I’d start to hesitate.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When I turned the ball over, I didn’t want it the next play.</span></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">My confidence didn’t run parallel to my preparation.</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It fluctuated. And when I’d get into a rut, it’d be a downward spiral.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But Colin was almost always </span><em><span style=\"font-size:18px\">emotionless</span></em><span style=\"font-size:18px\">.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Good game, bad game, didn’t matter.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He could miss </span><em><span style=\"font-size:18px\">every</span></em><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> shot and still want the ball in his hands with the game on the line.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Maybe the recipe for unwavering confidence goes as follows:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Preparation - emotion = confidence…</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Eh. I still think there’s something missing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There’s an element of confidence that doesn’t rely on preparation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s built on </span><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">trust.</span></strong></p><p><em><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ok, wait, that makes sense.</span></em></p><p><em><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You just watched me hash this out in real-time, so thanks for your patience.</span></em></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">People that have unwavering confidence aren’t prepared for every situation – but they have enough trust in themselves to figure it out.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I could go down the rabbit hole of where that trust comes from, but that would take a lot more critical thinking on my end, </span><em><span style=\"font-size:18px\">and you’re not really helping here.</span></em></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This newsletter was never supposed to offer profound advice or life lessons anyway.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There’s enough advice out there. I’d rather offer you my perspective and let you agree or disagree.</span></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Last thing I’ve internalized recently:</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Your reality acts as a mirror of your self-beliefs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s a common saying in sales that </span><em><span style=\"font-size:18px\">“whoever has the most certainty wins.”</span></em></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This couldn’t be more true, and it doesn’t just apply to sales.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If your beliefs about yourself aren’t strong, other people&#x27;s beliefs about you will start to manifest.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you don’t feel respected by those around you, it&#x27;s because you don’t respect yourself.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Choose who you are, or let others choose for you.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Sounds simple, but something to consider in your own life.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">That’s all for today.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Talk next quarter,</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p></div>",

Keep it up, Ben!”</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The liberal-wagie-cuck army on tik tok is starting to get to me.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ve had a couple of videos go semi *viral* recently, and half of my comments are people calling me a trust fund baby.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The other half are girls commenting on my eyelashes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Fuck off woman, no I don’t have a “lash tech,” and if I did, I wouldn’t refer you to them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And to be fair, I did grow up in a great neighborhood, but every dollar I’ve made has been on my own.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I actively tell my parents and grandparents that I don’t want their money.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Business is going swimmingly right now.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Clients are crushing, and I’m getting close to being out of poverty (I can taste $100k a month).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But in all honesty, it feels a bit dull.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">An extra $20k per month or so wouldn’t change much about my life right now.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Recently I’ve realized that money loses its value if you don’t utilize it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">My life now </span><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><em>looks</em></span><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> cool, but I was going out more and having more “fun” when I was making around $10k per month, living like a rockstar in a college town.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">My favorite thing I’ve been able to do recently is impact people around me.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Roughly 6 months ago, this 18-year-old kid found me on social media and asked me to mentor him by sending me a dollar on Venmo.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I had some money sitting in my Venmo account, and I sent him $1k back.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> Phillip used that money to buy a course from a friend of mine and is now making $10k a month in sales.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He’s moving out of his parent&#x27;s house next month.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Another dude who I call Scooby, has been replying to my emails updating me on his life.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He was in a tough situation, so my friend Mason and I bought him a laptop to help him start making money online (love you scooby).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">One of my best friends from college, Stevie, was born to be in sales.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This guy could make a brick wall laugh.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I helped him get into a great opportunity, and he closed his first deal (and made $500 in commission) today.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">These 3 situations are some of the highest ROI things I’ve been able to experience recently, and they have nothing to do with me personally making more money.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Funny how that works.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Being a catalyst to help other people grow is really fucking cool.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Sorry for the jumpiness in this email, I guess the zyn worked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Love you {{ subscriber.first_name }},</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p></div>",

It helped me connect with people who became friends and eventually clients.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The skills I’ve picked up have been a byproduct of me telling people I knew how to do things that I didn’t actually know how to do until I figured it out on the fly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I get to rely on warm inbound leads, my website sucks, I don’t use a CRM, and my offer isn’t easily replicable for each client.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><em><strong>I’m doing everything wrong, but business feels easy.</strong></em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And I think it’s because I’ve done the hard things right.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s taken me multiple years to build my Twitter presence and become a marketing “expert.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And now everything is coming to a perfect storm.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">My network is bigger, and I have the skills/ experience to meet the opportunity.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If I tried to teach someone how to do it the exact way I’ve done it, it’d take a while.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If they wanted quick success, I’d tell them to do a bunch of things that I don’t currently have to do.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But if you want to eventually stumble into a high-leverage position the way I have, do the following:</span></p><ul class=\"unordered_list\" style=\"list-style-position:inside\"><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Post more content &amp; don’t be a dork about it</span></span></li><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Connect with cool people and be genuine</span></span></li><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Say yes to any project that comes your way &amp; learn as much as you can</span></span></li><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Do everything in your power to get amazing results for clients</span></span></li><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Post more content about those results</span></span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><em><strong>There’s your simple 5-step system.</strong></em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Reply if you have questions, and I’ll get back to you within 337 business days.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Sweet dreams,</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">P.S.

And if no one gets through it, no one will buy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This leads me to my second point…</span></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">2 - Reading good copy</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You’re already subscribed to the best newsletter in the world (mine).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Why not add a few more?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Seeing different writing styles and the way various arguments are made will help you be more creative in your own writing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Any time you see a good ad, sales page, email, etc. – save it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I have a folder with 200+ funnels on my bookmarks tab.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I suggest you start to build one of your own.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Last and final point…</span></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">3 - Thinking &amp; doing other shit</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Many of my best realizations and ideas have come while doing something that isn’t writing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">One time I basically wrote an entire sales page in my head while I was at the gym.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I got home, and I just transcribed my brain onto a doc.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You need to give your mind quiet time to think.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The more you understand yourself and the way you operate – the more you’ll understand the world.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And a vast array of experience will give you a wider perspective which translates to you being a better writer.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Alrighty, this was a lot easier today.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you actually implement anything I told you to in this email - you’ll become a better writer.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Thanks for reading,</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">P.S.</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/benhbader/status/1674881898391252994?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> Here’s a 3-minute info-product marketing masterclass for you</span></a><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p></div>",

You have an idea of your destination – it&#x27;s a city you&#x27;ve always dreamed of visiting. But without understanding the terrain, the distances, and the possible roadblocks, you&#x27;ll likely end up lost or going in circles. Along the way, you need to gather information, learn how to navigate, and understand the characteristics of your vehicle. Similarly, following your passion without developing relevant skills and acquiring necessary knowledge can lead to frustration or even failure. Experience and understanding of the real-world terrain of your passion is crucial to reach your desired destination.</span></p></div>",

style=\"font-size:18px\">Finally.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m so back.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is the first ounce of creativity I’ve had in a week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">For a bit, I thought I was completely out of ideas, and I’d said every word of value that I could.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But I was wrong.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I have plenty to tell you about, and I just wasn’t giving my thoughts enough of a vessel to transfer into reality (whatever the fuck that means).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">As I was sitting outside Starbucks this morning, it hit me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The only reason people don’t find success in life &amp; business is because they fail to recognize opportunities that are presented to them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">They wander through life, perpetually messing up every chance they have at making a lot of money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">All it takes is one good connection or one win to completely change your life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">They get a well-respected client who could send them hundreds of referrals…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Buuut they can’t get results, so it falls apart.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Or they meet someone who can open various doors for them…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And they don’t go above and beyond to add value to that person&#x27;s life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s like they’re either blind to the opportunity or so nervous to mess it up that they just crumble.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">One of my first big personal brand clients was a guy named DJ Sakcmann.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He’s got about half a million followers on IG and is one of the main authorities in the online basketball training space.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I connected with him through a cold DM on Instagram.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">We got on a call, and he said needed a new funnel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I said, “say no more, fam” and spent the next 4 hours writing some of the best copy I’d ever written.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I built the entire landing page, and by the next morning, he had a new funnel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">At the time, I was making around 10k per month, so I obviously could charge for my work – but I didn’t ask him for a dime.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The funnel I built literally converted 5x better than the one he had previously, and it generated hundreds of thousands of dollars.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">For the next 4 months, I basically worked with him as an unpaid intern, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Not only did I eventually get paid a lot of money from DJ, but it opened so many doors for me.</span></p><ul class=\"unordered_list\" style=\"list-style-position:inside\"><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He sent me a handful of referrals</span></span></li><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It gave me confidence that I could get results in the info-product space</span></span></li><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And DJ is now a good friend of mine and one of my most notable case studies</span></span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But it would’ve been so easy to fumble this opportunity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I could’ve let my ego get in the way and asked for a lump sum of money upfront.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I could’ve stopped following up with him when he didn’t reply.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I could’ve half-assed the funnel and taken much longer to get it done.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But I recognized the potential upside in this partnership, so I seized it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is just one of many examples of the art of craftiness – the most overlooked skill in business. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m working with a kid right now named Kevin, who edited a recent podcast I did (without asking for money).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Not only am I gonna pay him, but I’ll send him intro’s to potential clients and give him advice on scaling his business…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Just because he has enough foresight to go out of his way to provide value for me and not be greedy by asking for a bunch of money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Odds are you’ve had chances in your life to help someone who can open doors for you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s up to you to recognize when those opportunities present themselves and go above and beyond to pounce on them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hope you enjoyed this email, I’m glad to be back.</span></p><p class=\"\">​<a href=\"https://youtu.be/5KMSdasV5Bc\" target=\"_blank\"

class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">His driveway looks like a luxury car shop.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Along with the boxter, he has a white 911 turbo, a new range rover, and a vintage beige Mercedes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He drove the 911 yesterday morning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ve become so accustomed to the sweltering heat in Miami that I’m wearing a hoodie on this cloudy 72-degree morning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The energy here is quite different from Brickell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s more laid back, and there seems to be a constant blue undertone in the sky.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">As I think about ways to transition this email to a life lesson, my mind is drawing a blank.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ve been stuck for the last few minutes staring at this blinking cursor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Whenever I feel like my well of original thoughts has run dry, there’s one thing that revitalizes my creativity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Movement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ll go on a walk, work out, or simply do anything to get myself away from my computer and back in touch with the thoughts in my head.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When I sit at my desk and try to force creativity, it usually eludes me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The harder you try, the harder it gets.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ve realized that much of the progress

style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ll get obsessed with something for a period of time, and the work starts to feel like play.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I don’t have to force myself to sit at my desk – I simply do it because it’s the obvious thing that I want to do at that moment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This trait seems to be a blessing and a curse.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s made it very difficult for me to do things that I don’t want to do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">In school, I absolutely hated homework.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’d do anything and everything that I could to avoid it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And in business, when there are tasks that I don’t feel like tackling, I’ll procrastinate until the final deadline.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Even if it’s something that literally takes me 3 minutes to knock out, it feels like a herculean feat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Obviously, you can’t always neglect the things you&#x27;re not excited about.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But there’s definitely a balance between doing work that allows you to enter a flow state and swimming upstream for too long and going in the wrong direction.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Not sure if that makes sense, but I have a handful of things that I’ve been putting off this morning that I need to go do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">They’ll take me about 3 minutes each.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I decided to write

The same goes for almost all of my friends, so I imagine it happens to you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The secret is discerning when a feeling needs to be accepted and when it needs to inspire change.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Before dropping out of college a few years ago, sometimes I’d quietly get anxious.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Although my life looked fun on the surface, I could simply </span><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><em>feel </em></span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">that path wasn’t right for me (emphasis on feel, not think).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There was objectively no fulfillment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I went out all the time and “celebrated” although I had nothing to celebrate – it was an escape from a life with a lack of purpose, ambition, or improvement.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If I didn’t change, it would’ve eaten me alive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">On the contrary, I’m now in a position that I was enamored by for years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But that doesn’t stop me from occasionally questioning if I’m an absolute idiot and if I should move across the country to live on a farm with Amish people and cows.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Odds are that’s just a natural low – in fact, I know it is because it feels different.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">So when those types of thoughts come up, I try not to give them power. I accept them as they are – the devil who will always be there on my shoulder.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And that’s okay.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hope this all made sense.

spending time in the sun</span></span></li><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Going to the gym</span></span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m sure there are others that I’m missing, but these are the core 5 that come to mind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s irresponsible to underestimate the power that little habits like this can have in our lives (speaking from experience, as you’ve seen some inconsistency in these emails lol). </span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">My friend Miles is one of the most dialed people I know when it comes to his routine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And it just so happens that he never seems to be down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He knows the handful of things that have to be done every day for him to keep moving the needle forward, and he doesn’t miss a day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Make a list of your non-negotiables and do them every day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I kind of sound like the corny self-improvement personal brand guy that I make fun of.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Maybe they have a point?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Moving on – success is inevitable when you pull the one big lever.</strong></span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I turn away most of the prospects that come to us because they simply don’t have enough traffic.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">They’re trying to optimize all the backend systems and their offer – but even if those two things are the best in the world, it won’t matter because no one is seeing it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you have a ton of traffic, you can do everything wrong and still make money – that’s when you know you’ve found something.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Similarly, in dating, when a girl truly likes you, you can break all the red-pill rules of “game,” and it’ll probably make her like you more.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You can be goofy, and you don’t have to try hard to have “frame control” because you are the frame – You’ve developed into someone worthy of respect and admiration, so simply leaning more into your nature and showing your personality will make that person like you more.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Last thing that’s been on my mind that I’ll attempt to articulate:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Playing in the different arenas of life will expose you to the fact that you need a true mission.</strong></span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You need to conquer your inclinations to side quest and quench those thirsts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">These can be new hobbies, traveling, dating, etc.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Only once you pursue them will you know that you cannot find fulfillment in them – and that’s a good thing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You’ll be able to enjoy these pleasures as they are and return to your main goal with more firepower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Not sure if this last point is making sense for you, but it’s one of the biggest things I’ve learned recently – let me know if it resonates at all.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I know this one was long and scattered, but hopefully, you enjoyed this somewhat rapid-fire style today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Let’s have a great week,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p></div>",

It makes me wonder how they operate on their own and if they just go throughout their day without water.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">2: We are hard-wired to be obsessed.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you’re smart, you get obsessed with something that brings you fulfillment and makes you money.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Your purpose is to find the things that are worth obsessing over for you and carry them out to their fullest potential.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is where you find the flow state.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">3: I’m (probably) not smarter than you.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Sometimes, I see people comment on my videos or reply to my emails saying things like, “How are you so wise for being this young?”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The answer is that I trust myself. I’ve developed enough conviction in my own perception of the human experience that seems to resonate with others. You, too, have the same wisdom if you care enough to listen to it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">4: Being intentional and setting goals put your subconscious to work.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Almost every time I put “make 2 tik toks” or “write 3 tweets” on my to-do list for the day, my brain starts feeding me ideas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This applies to any goal or desire in life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">5: When you utilize money to its maximum ability, you reach a new level of autonomy.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I buy $300 massages a few times per month (no happy ending). I didn’t realize this was “expensive” for a massage until the way a friend of mine reacted when I told them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It made me think about other little things like this that make me appreciate money – fancy dinners, clothes, sporting events, paid parking, and subscriptions, are all effectively free.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">6: I’m going to bed.</span></strong></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m not gonna proofread this, so if it was illegible or I spoke about my disdain for fat people - I’m sorry.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hope this was half-decent. If ya liked it, let me know!</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Gn,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p></div>",

Complacency. Living the same day for 50 years. Losing the spark with a girl and staying in the relationship only because finding someone else would be too hard. Or when the most exciting part of the day is hitting the green light at the busy intersection on the way home from work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Does the spark inevitably fail after a while or is that a lie that’s been perpetuated by these doom and gloom water cooler conversation and “wait till you’re 40” types?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Or are they actually the enlightened ones because they’re able to seem outwardly content with the “simple life” and I just don’t have enough appreciation for the little things?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Maybe. These are questions I don’t have the answers to.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">For now, I’m gonna go get the same tacos I eat every day for lunch, hop on the usual 3 pm meeting, hit the gym, and call it a day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ooh, it’s chest day. If it’s not too crowded and I can get a bench that’ll be the highlight of my day! </span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Some good basketball on tonight too.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Will circle back tomorrow!</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">P.S. </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/_BSkowY4T6A?si=Qv_Vk9_5RUhD8iFt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Watch my most recent podcast if you haven&#x27;t already</span></a>​</p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p></div>",

She’s clever, she can banter with you, and most of the time, you know what she’s thinking before a word comes out of her mouth.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s that kind of chemistry that makes other couples fight after seeing you out because it makes them question the depth of their relationship.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But one day, you start to develop eyes for a different girl.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">She’s equally beautiful, and you’re intrigued.

To be able to get rev shares where clients pay you $20k+ without batting an eye, you must become irreplaceable in their business. This is where the multitude of services we offer (and do better than 99% of other agencies) comes in handy.</span></span></li><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You need a team, but hiring doesn’t have to be difficult. I’m a horrible operator, and I didn’t want to have to babysit new team members I brought on. So, my team consists of 2 of my closest who were already very skilled in the work we do. And although I sacrifice some margin, it saves me so much time and headache that I would have if I tried to do everything on my own.</span></span></li><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Client results &amp; personal brand is the best form of outreach. Two months ago, I closed a new client who found me through Twitter and knew some of the people we work with. He’s paid us over $50k, mostly from our performance fees. I have opportunities like this come up frequently because of the two assets I mentioned above (client results &amp; personal brand).</span></span></li><li class=\"list_item\"><span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Do not be afraid to cut ties with clients when things are not going the way you need them to. I am selective with who I bring on, and I’ve learned that short-term cash is never worth the headache when I see red flags. I turn away most of the prospects that book calls with me if they don’t fit the criteria that I know we need to succeed.</span></span></li></ul><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you’re working in a similar type of business, I hope this helps. Feel free to reply and fire away with any questions.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Let get richer,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p></div>",

All the employees are wearing reindeer ears and the male barista attempts to hold eye contact with me for a few milliseconds too long.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I evade and tell him to make me an $8 iced latte with vanilla.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Before I got here, I was scouring my apartment. I tore up my office, dug under the couch, swept through the kitchen, and even looked in my bathroom although I knew there was little chance I’d find what I was looking for in there.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s not that I even wanted to find the item that bad, it’s that I knew it was there somewhere which was driving me crazy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But for now, I’m listening to Christmas music at this cafe because I had no luck finding my airpods.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I rarely wear headphones. But when I do, it’s because I’m in a noisy area and I want to write. Listening to my own music helps me feel like I’m in my own world where I can ignore the dorky-looking man at the counter to my right wearing a fanny pack around his shoulder.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I literally remember putting them on my counter yesterday.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Maybe someone broke into my apartment, ignored the expensive watches, my car keys, and any other more valuable items they could’ve taken, and decided to run away with my disgustingly earwax-stained airpods. Hahaha.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I had something I wanted to write to you about, but I’ve gotten so sidetracked that I completely forget it now. I guess it’s just that kind of morning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Something that’s been on my mind however is career paths.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I don’t understand how people can stay in one role in the same field for more than a few years.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Especially as entrepreneurs. Maybe I’m just immature, but thinking about doing the same exact thing I’m doing now for the next 3 years makes me want to chew glass.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Sure you can always make the argument that “feelings don’t matter. Do it anyway” blah blah.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And I know there will always be some things I don’t want to do in any business I run. But to me it just makes sense to upgrade or switch business models every few years (if that’s what feels right).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I get bored doing the same thing every day after a while.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Again, you can make a sound argument that it doesn’t matter how you feel and that you should power through the things you don’t want to do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But you can also make the counterargument that if you can find excitement in your work, you’ll be much more effective than when you’re dreading it. Even if that means your business model has to change or evolve every so often.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Last point on this and then I gotta run: I’m not saying you should constantly be jumping from one completely different business to another.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You likely have innate skills that can be applied in a variety of different ways, and sometimes being open to the application of your skill set in a similar or parallel field may make sense.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You with me here?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I could be completely wrong, but thanks for reading anyway.

And I had no cavities, so that was pretty cool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The online education industry still blows my mind sometimes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Nearly anyone who has acquired any niche skill has the capability to share their story on social media and find people who are willing to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to learn from them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">With the boom of short-form content, it’s never been easier to start making minute-long videos from your iPhone, and *boom* now you have a potential seven-figure business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is the situation for every single one of my clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">We’ve been working with a client who buys small local businesses.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s a much more complicated process than I’ll make it sound here, but basically, he has a system that allows anyone with a stable income and some money to invest to acquire a “boomer” business that cashflows around 6-figs per year right off the bat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The process of finding a type of business that’s a good buy is the most complicated part, but once an acquisition is complete, he can operate the business remotely and only spend about an hour per week on each business, making sure nothing catches on fire.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He started making content on social media, and just months later, we’re doing multi-six-figure months, and he’s got dozens of successful students.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There’s no real lesson here today, but I just wanted to make it clear how simple it can be to launch and scale an online education company.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ve got something coming for you soon if you’re someone who is building this type of business or something similar, so be on the lookout for my emails over the next few weeks.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Let’s hit the gas and build a life in 2024 where you don’t have to “look forward to the Holidays” because your whole life feels like a Holiday :)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Thanks for reading my words today.

    "content": "<style>@media only screen and (max-width:600px) {\n        .ck-mobile-font-size {\n          font-size: 50px !important;\n        }\n     }</style><div><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ve been in the online marketing space for about three years now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Throughout this time, I’ve met a lot of people who were trying to “make it” as entrepreneurs. Some completely failed, some stagnated, and others have been on par with the same level of success I’ve seen or have found financial success quicker than me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Obviously, there are unicorns, but for the most part, intelligence doesn’t seem to play a huge role as long a baseline level of competence is established.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s similar to being a professional athlete – at the highest levels, everyone is a “freak” athlete. It’s the minimum standard, and generally, the intangibles are what separates the good from the great.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Here are a few of the less tangible traits I see in my more successful friends (which those who stagnate or fail seem to lack):</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>1. Ingenuity &amp; craftiness: </strong></span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">In the world of entrepreneurship, rules are meant to be broken, loopholes are meant to be found, and the lines between what works and what doesn’t are blurred.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There’s a proclaimed “right way” to find success, and then there&#x27;s the way that actually works for you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Creativity and persistence will (sometimes) take you much further than blindly following a “proven system” that other people tell you to.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>2. Discipline &amp; the ability to create order in chaos: </strong></span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Freedom causes most people to lose their minds. When you’re accustomed to being told what to do, what to think, and where to be, having to tell yourself those things is a big adjustment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Build a system for yourself that works for you. Again, it doesn’t have to be what other people are doing as long as it puts you in an environment and mental space that allows you to do what you need to do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>3. Comfortable with the unknown: </strong></span><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Eventually, you come to the realization that no matter how much you plan, no matter how hard you try, and no matter how badly you want something to happen, you are not in complete control of the outcome.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Certainty makes us feel safe. And if you’re too attached to that feeling of safety, go get a desk job and a 401k.

I don’t have any advice on how to navigate it because truthfully, I don’t know if anyone does.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I guess that brings us back to trait #3, huh?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Alrighty, hope you liked this one.

Shit makes me nervous.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I immediately started thinking of excuses I could come up with to get out of it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Maybe I’ll plan a trip that weekend so that I have a legitimate reason to say no.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Or perhaps I’ll say my dog ate my computer and I can’t make the PowerPoint presentation. Or maybe I’ll start licking door handles and kissing homeless people so I can be sick that day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ugh.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">As my conscious thoughts run through a variety of excuses, I have a feeling in my stomach that tells me that I have to say yes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is a common occurrence among the things we don&#x27;t want to do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It can be as simple as when someone invites you to dinner, and you initially try to say no, but somehow you get roped into going.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Then you end up having a good time, and you&#x27;re glad you went.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But our ego wants to protect us. It wants to talk us out of putting ourselves in any position where there’s an opportunity to look like a fool or be challenged in any way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I could get up there, start my presentation, and forget how to pronounce my own name and lose my ability to speak english.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Imagine I do the whole thing in Spanish and no one understands it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But in reality — detached from the fragile, overbearing ego that’s inside of all of us, I know that it’s an experience that’ll be good for character development in the movie that I star in inside my own head.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And the </span><a href=\"https://ckarchive.com/b/68ueh8hkzw7nlckq88gqmtz7vxkkk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">last email</span></a><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> I wrote to you was literally about how getting over “the flinch” is all you need to be successful.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">So that’d be extremely hypocritical of me to bitch out because I’m nervous.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If there’s one thing I want you to take away from my rant today, it’s this:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You have conscious thoughts that your ego feeds you as a protection mechanism.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And then you have your gut feeling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Learn to decipher the difference between the two when you’re making a decision, and it might lead you to experiences that are necessary for your development.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Or you’ll embarrass yourself and never listen to me again.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Happy New Year,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p></div>",

It’s also clear that I’m not another self-proclaimed “expert agency owner” who regurgitates the same three talking points.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This makes it so people develop a bit of a relationship with me and my idealogy before we ever get on the phone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m telling you all this in order to show you that many things you may think you need to find success are often a facade.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Whether you run an agency or a completely different type of business, your success often boils down to a few key factors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Once you understand what those factors are, double down on them rather than wasting time trying to find the next magic pill that will carry you to the promised land.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Repeat successful actions, and success becomes inevitable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Let me know if you liked this one,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>P.S.</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> I’m making another YouTube video this week.

Absolute banger.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Anyway, I&#x27;ve got a good one for you today (I think).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ve never publicly shared a ton about the ins and outs of how we’re scaling our clients&#x27; info-product businesses because it’s always felt a bit boring. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Honestly, scaling a coaching program or course business to $500k/mo+ is shockingly simple.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I know that may sound like a crazy amount of money, but here are some of the main things I’ve learned about how we got there *by accident.*</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">- Traffic solves all. </span></strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You can have the best offer in the world, pay me $20k to build out your funnels, and hire Jordan Belfort as your closer. But none of it will matter if you don’t have eyeballs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">- If you can’t crack organic content, you should probably get a 9-5. </span></strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Seriously. If you have something to sell and you’re unable to get attention on the internet in 2024, you should be an accountant instead. The entire multi-7-figure business I’m writing about was built off of short-form content.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">- Do not forget to build your plane while you’re flying it. </span></strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Because these businesses scale so fast, there’s a lot of added complexity to the product and fulfillment side. If you neglect the customer experience, you will crash and burn on a long enough time horizon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">- Systems only matter at scale.</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> We neglected a lot of the optimizations and organizational aspects of the business until we were already making multi-6-figs per month. Until then, we only focused on more traffic, more webinar registrants, and more booked calls.</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">- There is no secret sauce. </span></strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I can’t emphasize this enough: Build offer, get attention. Build offer, get attention. Build offer, get attention. Fix everything else later. The degree to which you can scale is dependent on your ability to consistently bring more people into your funnel who know, like, and trust you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Enough writing for today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I hope this helped you in some way, and if it didn’t, thanks for wasting some time with me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">By the way, there were a lot more people than I anticipated who replied to </span><a href=\"https://ckarchive.com/b/xmuph6hroe3o7hrnppvnqc03lpkll\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">my email yesterday</span></a><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> about the consulting group that I’m opening up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m still mapping out the details in my head, but I’ll have more info for you soon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Thanks for chatting with me today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Talk soon,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p></div>",

They ask for a refund or chargeback after doing 1% of the work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">These are the terminally ill. They were never gonna make it anyway. And you’re better at spending their money than they are, right?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The second reason success rates decline is because it’s fucking difficult to manage hundreds (or thousands) of customers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Many won’t get the support they need unless they proactively seek it out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Plus in some situations, teaching a large batch of people the same methods to start a business can make those methods less successful.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Does this make selling info products immoral or evil?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Here’s the flip side:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Let’s say 100 people buy a course that teaches them how to start a marketing agency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">95 people give up after a few months and lose the few hundred or few thousand dollars they’d spent on the course.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But 5 people actually commit to building this business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">6 months to a year later, they’ve completely changed their lives.

We’ll make a bunch of future all-stars and live vicariously through them as I grow old and start taking TRTs so I can keep up with my much younger model wife.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hahaha.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Speaking of girls, I’ve been reflecting on some things I’ve learned about dating recently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">First, women are amazing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Nearly every girl I meet is pleasant to be around and has their own unique vibe (if they’re comfortable enough to show that side of themself to you).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Don’t listen to the losers who tell you Western women are ruined. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Sure, not every girl you meet is gonna be a potential wife, and that’s okay.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Understanding this allows you to appreciate them for who they are and simply have fun.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It also gives you a more complete perspective on what qualities you look for in someone you would take more seriously and potentially date.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Next, take it slowwwwwww.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you scroll through TikTok, you’ll see “dating coaches” say that you need to commit to someone within 1-3 months.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is absolutely crazy in my opinion. Normalize 6-12 month talking stages. Sometimes longer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Seriously.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It takes time to get to know someone. There are many things you’ll learn about them that will only come out over time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Rushing into a relationship is a surefire way that it’ll go up in flames.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And no, this isn’t just a way to keep your freedom and avoid exclusivity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It ensures that you guys actually know each other before you put a label on it. Because that label will only complicate things.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Little fights turn into UFC matches (not physically, I hope) and if the foundation of the relationship isn’t rock solid, it’ll collapse.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Last thing and most important one.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you’re a girl reading this, you should stop here. I’m sorry it has to be this way, but it does.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The solution to 99% of your “girl problems” is solved by having…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">options.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Lots of them. 3 Barbies, 2 Cinderellas, a Tinekerbell, and maybe a Harley Quinn or 3.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This sounds bad when I say it out loud like this, but I’m doing so for a reason:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Detachment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Neediness has to be the #1 turn-off for women. And when she’s your only option, she can feel it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Women are intuitive little creatures. They’re actually harder to deceive than men.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When you’re someone who truly has options, you care less about losing one of them, and it changes your entire demeanor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You’re not a dancing monkey trying to impress her. You’re you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">They’ll never admit it, but they like a man with options.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Crucify me. But I’m right.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ok, enough for today. Lmk if you liked my takes on this topic and want to hear more.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Take a pretty model on a date tonight,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">P.S. </span></strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">One of my subscribers suggested I take my old emails and basically turn them into a little blog.

Or coffee shops? Merging onto a highway?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s like their systems get overloaded, and they revert to monkey brains, where they just start making sounds and looking for bananas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Anyway, let’s talk about more important things.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Imagine you’re building yourself a car.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You get all the parts you need and spend countless hours configuring your vehicle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Finally, you’re ready to hit the road.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You hop in and start driving.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">At first, it’s great. You’re excited to finally enjoy the fruits of your labor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But after a few hundred miles, the engine starts making a strange noise.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You pull over and pop the hood.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s a minor problem, and you know exactly what you need to do to fix it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You close the hood and tell yourself you’ll fix it later.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">As you continue driving, you see another car and are immediately enamored.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">“That’s the kind of car I want,” you think to yourself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When you get home, you order parts and set out to build it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Over the next few months, you start neglecting car #1, and the minor problem with the engine has turned into a much bigger issue.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Instead of fixing it, you spend all your time building a new car.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And finally, once your “perfect” car is ready, you hit the road. And the cycle continues. You see a new car you like better, neglect your own, and start all over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">See where I’m going with this?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is how many of us treat our businesses, relationships, and a variety of other endeavors.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">We spend so much time laying the foundation for what could be something special.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But once the novelty wears off and we realize the constant maintenance that’s necessary for continuous progression, we start looking for the &quot;new thing.&quot;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Instead of putting our feet on the gas and maximizing what’s in front of us, we let what we’ve built deteriorate so that we can have an excuse to start all over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s a familiar comfort. It allows for the illusion of productivity. But it keeps you stuck.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And don’t you want to find out how far you can go if you can resist the urge to turn your head every time you see a new girl in a red dress?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Water your own plants. Today, tomorrow, and especially in 6 months when it’s no longer as exciting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Thx for reading,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p></div>",

Social media</strong></span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you go look at my Instagram toward the end of July, you can see a shift occur.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Even my facial expression and demeanor appear more confident in more recent photos.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I know it may sound superficial, but putting effort into making a better-looking Instagram and posting consistently on TikTok has opened so many doors and brought me a world of connections.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">These three things helped me enter a version of myself that I couldn’t access previously.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">My lifestyle is exactly the way I envisioned it when I pictured living in Miami.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Although this is just a “side quest” to the main mission (getting disgustingly rich), it’s brought me a lot of clarity and taught me lessons that I couldn’t have learned at my desk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Cheers to life-maxxing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Call your ex today,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>P.S.</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> Reply if you read this whole thing and happy early Valentines Day baby &lt;3</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>",

I took a personality quiz, changed my return flight, got ahead on some work, and did enough research on LA restaurants that I could write one of those gay “Top 10 MUST TRY spots in LA” blog posts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Just so you know, I’m in seat 1A.

I was </span><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><em>physically</em></span><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> there, but my mind would drift, drowning out the person who was talking with my own thoughts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">These times were interesting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This fight-or-flight mode wasn’t pleasant, but I think it helped me progress quicker.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">All I thought about was business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Recently, it’s been the opposite.

But nearly every time I set intentions like this, completing the action becomes easier.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Although this is just one basic example, I hope it’s starting to illustrate the point.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">What you focus on and put your attention toward grows, even if you’re not conscious of it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you’re obsessed with reaching a new income level, your brain is constantly working on that problem in the background.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You’ll get an idea while you’re driving or doing some other mindless activity, and it’ll be the key to reaching that next milestone you’re aiming for.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You might feel like the idea came out of nowhere, but it’s likely because you’ve given your subconscious something to occupy itself with.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And eventually, it finds the solution.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The same thing goes for anything that you want in life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you can create a clear image of the lifestyle, people you’re surrounded by, what you’re doing for work, how your routine looks, and the general way of life you want to build…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And you work towards those things…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The combination of the work and setting intentions will eventually reach a perfect storm and you’ll feel like everything somehow ended up exactly how you wanted it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The way that your goals unfold likely won’t be how you imagined, but that’s a topic for another email.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hope you enjoyed this one and it made sense to you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Happy Friday,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">P.S.</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> </span><a href=\"https://benbader.com/profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I finally compiled my old emails and aded them to this site</span></a><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> – you don’t have to opt in over there, just scroll down to view previous newsletters.</span></p><p class=\"\">​</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",

Maybe it’s just a phase of life that you’re in, or you’re especially selective about who you spend an extended period of time with.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But if and when you move past the casual fling stage, you realize there’s no longer a place to hide.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Your flaws and insecurities are reflected back to you when you let someone get to know the real you, and that process reveals your self-image.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Fake confidence only lasts for so long, and if there are areas in your identity that you’re not comfortable with, you’ll be forced to make amends with them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I hope this makes sense to you. I’d go a bit more in-depth, but I just realized that I have hundreds of new subscribers here.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Some of whom are probably ops that were angry at my tweet and will do anything they can to take what I say in this email out of context.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">So I’ll let them weed themselves out, and then we’ll continue our regularly scheduled programming.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Anyway, It’s date night with sweet pea tonight!</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Can’t wait to try the restaurant and watch our favorite show on the couch!!!!</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hah.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Happy early Easter,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">P.S.</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> If you’re new here, </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/RG6_tbHknJI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">watch this to learn more about me and how I built a 7-figure copywriting business.</span></a>​</p><p class=\"\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">P.P.S. </span></strong><a href=\"https://benbader.com/posts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Check out my previous emails here.</span></a>​</p><p class=\"\">​</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",

cellSpacing=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;margin:0 auto\"><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ve grown to love the peaceful Sunday night at home.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When I was in school, this day was always dreadful.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Monday morning was around the corner and the looming stockpile of work I’d been procrastinating was staring me in the face.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I was just debating whether or not I’d write an email to you today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There are a million excuses my brain could come up with as to why I shouldn’t.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But then I thought about the feeling I get after completing one of these.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s like when the endorphins kick in after a tough workout.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Maybe you didn’t want to do it, but you always feel better once it’s done.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There are many things that we resist even though we know they’re good for us.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you’re building a business you can likely think of a few off the top of your head.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The boring 30 minutes of outreach.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The long meeting with your sales team.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Or the time spent planning your week to stay on track with your next income goal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Usually, with tasks like this, the only immediate reward you get is internal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Going to the gym once won’t add 15 pounds of muscle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You won’t close a client right after sending 20 DM’s.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And writing this email does nothing for me financially at the moment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But these things give us that type of dopamine that can only be earned when we know we’re doing something positive for our future selves.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When a goal is accomplished, it’s a lagging indicator that shows you consistently completed those sometimes monotonous actions that yield you next to nothing in the short term.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">As I contemplated writing this, I considered how I felt yesterday after I clicked send.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I knew replicating that same feeling would be worth it (plus, I actually enjoy writing these).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">So I guess that’s my first piece of advice:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Any time you resist something good for you, think back to how you felt after the last time you did it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And if it’s something that you’ve never done before, replace that image with anything else you once felt a sense of accomplishment after completing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you can’t think of anything, you’re cooked.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But if you can, use it as fuel to complete the task in front of you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is how you rewire your brain to crave long-lasting, deserved dopamine rather than cheap, social media-infused dopamine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s like how you view a relationship with someone who is easy to get versus someone you have to work for.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You’re always gonna place more value on the person who’s a challenge because you had to earn it, which shows they value themself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When you bring a girl home after buying her two drinks and making fun of her shoes, that usually means she isn’t wifey material because if you could do it that easily, so could someone else.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Compared to the more elusive girl, who, although she likes you, wants to make sure you’re really the person you appear to be before she fully trusts you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And that’s the difference between cheap dopamine and deserved dopamine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The more you can teach your brain to run toward the hill that’s harder to climb, the better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Anyway, hope you’re avoiding the Sunday scaries and ready to crush the week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Talk tomorrow,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span

write this.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Yesterday, I wrote a tweet about shifting your identity and wanted to expand on it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s long, so it’ll take up the majority of this email, but I genuinely think this is one of the keys to making continuous progress in any realm of life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Here it is:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The speed at which you progress is dependent on your ability and willingness to shift into a new identity when you complete the vision you were formerly working toward.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When you actualize financial/lifestyle goals, it’s like you’re beating a level in a video game. the next level is an entirely different game, and you’re starting at zero with new obstacles that you’re unfamiliar with.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Sometimes, you may fail or refuse to move to the next level because you’re comfortable with the current level you’re operating at and the problems associated with it. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is where you get trapped.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Stay in one identity for too long, and your lack of progression starts to eat away at you. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">So, you begin to sabotage your current reality because you want to feel like you’re moving forward.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The only way to do that while avoiding a complete shift in your identity is to first move backward and then go back up the ladder you already climbed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">So you’re now spending your time beating the same level of a video game only to click the reset button and start over.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is the trap of stagnation, where you give yourself the illusion of progress.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ve found that whenever I feel stuck, it’s because I’m simply refusing to step into a new identity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Perhaps you’ve heard the saying, “The vehicle that gets you to point A isn’t the vehicle that gets you to point B.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Similarly, the person you are right now has a ceiling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You can reach a certain level financially, emotionally, and spiritually.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Once you reach the peak of that level, you have the choice to continue progressing or stay where you are.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And change is hard.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is especially true when that change requires you to discard your previous beliefs about yourself and replace them with beliefs that will suit you in the new arena you are stepping into.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You can spend eons avoiding this and fool yourself into believing you’re making progress when you’re actually sputtering.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But this will only create an internal hell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You know you’re capable of more, and you’re resisting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The solution here can be summed up into three words:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><em>Decide, commit, act.</em></span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Devise a plan to reach your next level, paint a vivid picture of how this new version of you operates, and execute that plan.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s the work you’re avoiding, the habits you’re refusing to develop, and the beliefs that hurt to change.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’ll be painful, but so will the feeling of staying the same.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And this is the only way through.</span></p><p

They greeted me with love and told me to have a great day.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I smiled and tossed the barista the keys to my G Wagon.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Then, everything changed.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I opened my phone and went to Instagram.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Boom, I see another pitch from some little ass kid telling me he could be my “growth operator.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He said, “Ben, did you know you could monetize 1% of your audience??? I can make you $30k per month!”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you don’t know what “growth operating” is, let me fill you in.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You partner with someone who has a big audience, help them set up a Skool community, and take 50% of the profits.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s basically a simplified version of what we do at my info-product agency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Obviously, I think it’s a solid business model to run, and it’s made me 7 figures.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But I think there’s a bit of a misconception about how it’s been positioned online.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">From firsthand experience, I can promise you that helping someone scale an info-product is complex.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There are many moving pieces in these types of businesses, and you need to have a broad skill set along with a general understanding of the info-product space to succeed as a service provider.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You write email copy, build funnels, script video sales letters, build systems, and orchestrate the sales process.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you’re a complete beginner, it’s damn near impossible to learn all these skills at once.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Instead, it makes much more sense to start by learning one thing and one thing only – copywriting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s the foundation of my business and the reason I’ve scaled to 6 figures per month with my info agency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">We’ve scaled offers from zero to $600k/month and orchestrated over a dozen multi-six-figure launches.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">We helped a client go from $30k/mo to $350k/mo in a month and a half, and our smallest clients are making a minimum of $1m/year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But I didn’t end up in this position by saying I wanted to be a “growth operator.” That term didn’t even exist.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I worked as a freelance copywriter/marketer and eventually accumulated the skills required to run a full-stack agency for info products.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If I were starting all over again, I’d start by becoming the best copywriter I could be. I’d study all types of copy – emails, ads, sales pages, VSLs, direct mail, billboards.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Then I’d start doing outreach to get clients while continuing to learn supplementary skills like funnel building, the different types of funnels, when to use which, how to navigate zapier, sales process management, etc.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Once I had a better understanding of these things, I’d pitch my copywriting clients on more services.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Get one really good case study, and boom – now you have a real business.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Let me clarify, though: I’m not saying the growth operator business model is bad. The guys who teach it are legit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But it’s not a beginner business model, and you won’t get anywhere close to 50% profits from any creator who knows what they’re doing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you’re starting from scratch, learn copy, and the next door will open for you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hope you enjoyed this one,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span><a href=\"https://benbader.com/posts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Read my previous emails here.</span></a><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p><p class=\"\">​</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",

You don’t understand that most things are temporary and there are few universal truths.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But because you’ve fully convinced yourself that your way is the right way, when you encounter a situation where that belief is challenged, you take it as a threat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s why someone who follows the college, 9-5 route gets angry when they see a 16-year-old with their annual salary on their wrist.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And on the contrary, it’s why a struggling entrepreneur feels the need to criticize 9-5ers so they can solidify that they made the right choice in their own mind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There’s a sliver of doubt that they’re attempting to cover up by denying that any alternative could be true.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But that’s the thing – the alternative can almost always be true.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">One thing I know with 100% certainty is that my outlook on life will change over time. It’s supposed to.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Different seasons in life bring additional perspectives.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m not saying you should lack conviction in your current beliefs if you’ve thoughtfully crafted them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Just understand that they may change over time.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Don’t marry your beliefs, or you’ll end up bitter when you see someone succeeding in a different lane than you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There are a million ways to win. Choose yours.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Alright, I gotta go to boxing, and </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/r49pxktAfW4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">you gotta watch this video.</span></a><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Happy Friday,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\">​</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",

Your validation is giving me the motivation to upload consistently, so please keep it up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Recently, I’ve been thinking about how copywriting has impacted my life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Not only has it helped me build my business, but it’s served as an outlet for me to develop more concrete ideas.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">For the last couple of years, I’ve been journaling, tweeting, or writing an email nearly daily.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It feels like a form of art.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">In simple terms, I’m taking ideas that are jumbling around in my head and assembling them into a series of words that form a complete thought.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This has made me a more articulate speaker as well.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Whether talking to friends, on a date, or making content, I feel the ripple effect that comes from writing consistently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Being able to use your words and share your perspective with someone in a way that may persuade them to agree with your beliefs feels like a superpower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Whether or not you want to build a business that involves copywriting, I genuinely think getting into the habit of writing consistently is one of the highest ROI activities you can do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Once you hone this skill, a world of opportunities opens up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It can lead to a successful business, deeper relationships with others, and/or a loyal audience of people on the internet that resonate with your beliefs.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And as I think about the most successful entrepreneurs I know, this is almost always their unfair advantage.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Switching gears a bit, another thing that’s been on my mind is the value that comes with continuous learning.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">School tricked us into thinking that education is a boring chore.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This causes most people to put little time into gaining new information once they graduate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But learning new things should be fun.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m sure there are dozens of topics that you are naturally curious about and would enjoy exploring further.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And who knows – maybe it could lead to more money, a better social life, or at least give you an interesting topic to discuss at the dinner table.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When you’re constantly learning new things, you become more unique and interesting. And being a wealth of knowledge is cool.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I encourage you to take some time each day to learn about something new. It doesn&#x27;t have to be about money or anything that even offers you any tangible benefit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Simply allow your curiosity to lead you and someway, somehow, you’ll be glad you did.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is a part of how you develop into a well-rounded version of yourself, </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/SuO_9tFc_9U?si=Ck0CqzMS4HPKfQsw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">which I talk more about here.</span></a>​</p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Anyway, I gotta record some course content (which you’ll have access to soon), and Grammarly is pissing me off again because it keeps suggesting retarded edits to my writing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Go watch my latest YT video if you haven’t already :)</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Love you,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\">​<a href=\"https://benbader.com/posts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">P.S.

And be handsome.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I got carried away writing this first point and now I forget the other things that were on my mind.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hmmm.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m sitting outside at Starbucks and another corporate drone just rode by on a scooter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Oh, next thing that that I was thinking about:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>2. If getting clients is a struggle, you’re being a bot.</strong></span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This relates to my first point but THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">“I can’t get any clients, I’ve been sending the same retarded pitch to everyone for 3 months and no one replies.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">CHANGE YOUR PITCH.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Test shit. That’s life. You test until something works for you, even if it goes against the “proven system” that cornballs on the internet give you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">One of the copywriters I consulted with got his first couple of clients by digging through Youtubers channels, finding their email addresses, and pitching them via email.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">No one taught him that. But that’s ingenuity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The first time I heard the word “ingenious,” I had just broken into my high school gym to play basketball.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">There was a hidden key in the storage closet to turn the lights on and lower the hoops. I’d found it months before, but one day, I walked in there, and it was gone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">“Goddamnit, Terry,” I thought to myself. She was the athletic trainer who would always kick me out because it was a liability for a minor to be in the gym without supervision.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I bent the metal part of an old lanyard I found in my backpack and made a new key. It worked.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">A few days later, Terry walked in right after I used my makeshift key to get the baskets down.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">She asked how I did it, and I told her I had made a new key. That’s when she said, “Well, that was ingenious of you.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">In my head, I was like “fuck yeah it was Terry.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Anyway, I’m rambling, but if you’re stuck right now, BE CRAFTY.

The sun went down and the lighting in my apartment makes the video look grainy once it gets dark.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I turned off the camera and am now sitting here writing to you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s funny because yesterday I wrote an email to you about overcoming the initial resistance you feel when starting something new.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And today, I couldn’t beat it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I started to feel bad for myself after the initial VSL failure.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And then during my walk earlier, I opened an email reply from someone on this list.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">They said “Thank you Ben for rekindling this flame inside me with these emails.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">That’s when I realized that the decision to pity myself after things didn’t go as planned is incredibly selfish.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m making videos and sharing content on the because it feels like something I have to do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">As a byproduct, I get to inspire other people and impact lives for the better.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Obviously, I’m not on the front lines here risking my life for the benefit of humanity, but making </span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">content like this is probably one of the most influential things I can do with my time at the moment.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When I think about, the possibility that I even impact a few people for the better vastly makes up for days like today, where I struggle.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I get messages and comments every day from people telling me that I’ve helped them in some way.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And to say “woe is me” while sitting and pouting about a couple of unsuccessful videos is childish, bitch-like behavior. I have a responsibility here, and it’s my obligation to uphold it. I’m too blessed to feel sorry for myself. The mission doesn’t allow for pity.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is the pep talk I heard in my head. Perhaps it applies to you as well.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">In general, I think the worst thing you can do in any situation is to feel sorry for yourself. It makes you powerless. It’s a slap in the face to anyone who supports you or roots for you, as you’re not even giving the same level of respect to yourself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">No more pity parties.

I go to school that 70% gorl. I join frat to seem normal so I get mor gorl. I go gym to get big and strwong so gorl like me.”</p><p class=\"\">Because he was a robot, he took a very direct approach to the above goal.</p><p class=\"\">He thought that all of the things above would make him desirable.</p><p class=\"\">And while he did have some ‘success,’ Joes intentions became clear to anyone with half a brain.</p><p class=\"\">He didn’t pledge a fraternity because he wanted to make genuine friends; he did so to make it look like he had friends.</p><p class=\"\">He was obsessed with the gym because, in his mind, it would make him desirable to women.</p><p class=\"\">Robo-Joe tried to cover up his intentions by becoming your typical jacked frat bro.</p><p class=\"\">And he wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, so it didn’t really work.</p><p class=\"\">Fun fact: our wardens actually made him play brain games for 20 minutes a day and report back with his progress because he was quite slow.</p><p class=\"\">Anyway, I’m telling you all about Robo-Joe because this is the approach most people take when they want something.</p><p class=\"\">Let’s say you want to get your first client and decide that you’re just gonna spam DM a bunch of people without doing any research on who they are or what you should offer them.</p><p class=\"\">You do that for 3 months, and it doesn’t work because you’re retarded so you quit.</p><p class=\"\">That’s the direct Robo-Joe approach.</p><p class=\"\">Let’s talk about the better way to get what you want…</p><p class=\"\">The first five info-product clients I got were all online basketball trainers.</p><p class=\"\">I went 4/4 on outreach, and one of them (who had half a million followers) reached out to me first.</p><p class=\"\">So, to make it clear, I sent four messages and got five clients, which is statistically impossible if you’re not named Ben Bader.</p><p class=\"\">The reason this worked wasn’t because of my script or even any crazy case study.</p><p class=\"\">It was because of two things:</p><ol class=\"unordered_list\" style=\"list-style-position:inside\"><li class=\"list_item\"><span>I existed on the internet.

However, they are very good at making lattes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Anyway I’m sitting outside Starbucks, sipping on a cold brew with vanilla cream and sugar, and thinking about how much of a hypocrite I am.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I just got jealous of a homeless man because he looked happy and had really good posture.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I can’t help but judge the man a couple tables away from me wearing a suit on his lunch break.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I started off this email by making fun of those who look forward to Fridays and weekends, but I’d be lying if I said my mood isn’t slightly better on days like this.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> And if I actually followed the majority of the advice I give on the internet, I’d be a billionaire by now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">A wise man once said, “The most honest people are hypocrites.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The wise man who said that is the same one who’s writing this email.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And if you’re still reading by now you’re probably wondering where the lesson is or what I’m gonna “teach” you here.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">My goal is not to teach but rather entertain.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The richest people are the entertainers. Think about Tate. His message wasn’t something that others hadn’t said prior.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But he blew up because the guy is just outrageous. The way he speaks, the stories he tells, and the unapologetic expression of his thoughts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It was refreshing to see someone who genuinely seemed not to care if people didn’t agree with him while simultaneously saying what everyone else was thinking.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">On another note, most of the successful people I know are really lazy when they’re uninterested.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Myself included — I’ve always had a really hard time doing things I don’t want to do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ll wait until the final deadline, half-ass the project, cheat off the Asian kid, and do everything I can to get by while putting in minimal effort.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But when I’m bought in and find something that I’m interested in, I turn into an autistic computer engineer.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I can spend hours at my desk without losing focus.

existing audiences and help them make way more money than they would without us.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">For most of our clients, our work is relatively the same – we build the similar landing pages, write similar emails, and even the VSL and webinar scripts are relatively templated.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">On our end, there’s minimal difference in the workload between a client who pays us $5k/month versus one who pays us $30k/month.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The singular variable is attention.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">We recently started working with a guy who has a really solid audience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He has multiple six-figure followers, good engagement, and his content is fire.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">From one post on Instagram and Tik Tok, he’s gotten the number of leads that we should be able to generate around a quarter million dollars from over the next week.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">From one post.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Let me reiterate – the one difference between him and someone who makes little money from info is the audience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Someone else could have the same story, results, success, expertise, etc.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But if they don’t have a loyal audience of people who know, like, and trust them on the internet, it means nothing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Attention is everything.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Whether you’re trying to build your own coaching business or you’re doing something similar to me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Your marketing efforts, systems, and positioning do not matter if no one is seeing it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">So if you’re a copywriter or “gRoWtH oPeraToR” keep this in mind when trying to get clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">To get a killer case study, you need a killer client – a pig with lipstick on is still a pig. lol.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Anyway, I’ve been having a ton of fun working with the students inside the Copy MBA Inner Circle, and it’s dope to see them getting results from it.</span></p><p class=\"\">​<a href=\"https://www.copymba.com/bb-ic1?el=ben-email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you wanna make money as a copywriter or growth operator you should go here and apply so I can make you rich ok?

class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s been rainy and gloomy here in Miami for the past few days.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The sky is white right now but there’s no rain coming down so I’m sitting on my balcony as I write this to you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Over the last few days I’ve really noticed how the weather impacts my mood.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m a firm believer that 99% of problems can be fixed with a long walk in the sun.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When it was constantly raining and I was unable to do so, I started to go crazy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Anyway it’s unusually quiet for a Saturday in the middle of Brickell.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Usually there&#x27;s this dude who bikes around carrying a beat box.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He’ll stop on random street corners and start break dancing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Imagine you’re hungover at 8am on a Saturday and you’re woken up by a Bad Bunny song.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You get up, walk out onto your balcony and see some guy with pink hair and the shape of a heart on the back of his head. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He&#x27;s blasting music and dancing like a freak.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You’d probably try to snipe him right?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I tried once but hit an old lady by accident.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Maybe someone finally got him because it’s quiet today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Anyway, the other day I hosted a group call inside of Copy MBA.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Someone asked a question about “writers block” when first starting out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Whether you want to build a copywriting business and you’re trying to practice, or you just want to start writing in general, this is inevitable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This student was trying to write a sample email for this supplement brand, but whenever he opens a google doc, he stares at a blinking cursor and eventually closes his laptop.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Happens.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I asked him what sport he played growing up.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He told me he does mixed martial arts so I recommended that he find someone who is selling MMA courses or pick a clothing brand in that space and write for that instead.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The reason this is effective is because it’s much easier to write about things you’d be in the market for.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Especially when you’re first starting out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When I started, I was writing copy for basketball trainers.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">In every email, every ad, and every funnel I built – I was writing to my previous self.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I understood the pain points and desires of the market because I was the market.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And this made practicing 100x easier.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Between this and building the habit of writing every day, I got better quickly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you want to get better at copy, you need to write for fun.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Start journaling.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Start tweeting.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Write a love letter to your ex.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Go sit down in a coffee shop and write about the barista that held eye contact for too long when taking your order.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Write about the idiot who’s standing in the middle of the doorway.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Write about the poor bastard who passes by on a scooter in work clothes with a backpack on.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Describe what you see in detail.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Make it entertaining and don’t hold back</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Just write.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It will make your life better.

me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s early in the morning so there&#x27;s a really cool blue/white-ish/yellowish tone in the sky.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span

style=\"font-size:18px\">Anyway, I have an important topic for you today.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you understand this one thing, you gain complete control of your life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It creates a reality where everything becomes a choice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">From making more money, to improving your relationships, to feeling good about your daily routine.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You simply decide to make something happen and reality follows suit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And luckily, the key to all of this is incredibly straightforward.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ownership.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Taking ownership is how you make things happen with the push of a button.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m not referring to the “everything is your fault” type of narrative that you might hear online.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But rather understand that everything is your choice.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When you make a concerted effort to accomplish something, the outcome is largely dependent on you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Sure, there are variables that you don’t control and you need to accept that.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But obsessing over, or placing blame on those variables will make you powerless.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">So when you hear yourself start to blame external factors for why things aren’t working out in your favor, simply cut that narrative.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Even if it’s partially true, it doesn’t serve you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s like if you’re playing a sport and you have a bad head coach who doesn’t let you play the way you want to.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You can complain about it, underperform and be miserable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Or you can keep doing your best regardless of the situation.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Taking this approach to life makes you unfuckwithable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If there’s a situation in your business that isn’t going according to plan, you fix it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Even if that means a client is slacking on their responsibilities.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Or a team member isn’t performing the way you need them to.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Or there was a change in the algorithm and your old system isn’t working the same.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You take the problem into your own hands.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And you don’t do so with bitterness for other people in the equation, for they aren’t on my email list and didn’t get equipped with this superpower.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You are the master of your reality and no one and no thing can throw you off your shit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">That’s the mindset that serves you best and makes success

like a Kathy) extinguished that problem quickly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">That’s the lesson.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you’re selling agency services or coaching, or literally anything…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">MOVE FASTER.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ve personally lost deals because I was too slow or wasn’t “available” until a few days later.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">By then the urgency is gone.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And the pain that comes with a fresh problem is diminished, meaning getting the sale is gonna be harder.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is why it’s a good rule of thumb to have a sales team that dials every lead immediately (if you run a coaching business and you’re not doing this, that means you enjoy poverty).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">One of the first lessons I was taught when I started running ads for local basketball trainers 4 years ago, was “speed = lead.”</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I was in this coaching program and my coach told me to drill this message into the heads of my clients.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">My job was to get them leads, but if they don’t contact those leads ASAP, then they’re throwing money down a furnace.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">As you know, business is just a game of solving problems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The bigger problems you solve and the faster you can do so, the more money you make.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The first moving company that called me late on a Sunday got my business and charged me $1,200 to move me 5 minutes down the street.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Maybe there was a cheaper option.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But the problem was resolved and I’m happy to pay a premium for the efficiency.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span><a href=\"https://go.benbader.com/the-artisan-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span

class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I went for a run and then tried to meditate but it didn’t really work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Now I’m here, typing to you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m actually sitting at the desk in my “office,” which is really just a den.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Since I moved about three weeks ago, this has been the last area of my new apartment that still needs work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The lighting in here is kind of depressing and I have a bunch of random belongings on the floor.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Because of this, I’ve avoided this room.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">My phone is in the kitchen because I’ve been really addicted to it recently.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s cool that you can get rich and all from your fingertips but wow can that device be destructive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">On my run earlier, I thought about what it must’ve been like to be a young man who was shipped off to fight in the Vietnam war.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Imagine you’re a 19 year old kid, fresh out of high school.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You’re awakened in the middle of the night by Forrest Gump.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He grabs you by the ear and takes you with him.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Next thing you know you have an AK-47 in your hands and you’re shooting at anyone who has squinty eyes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">What a turn of events, huh?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">All of the problems you had prior to being drafted have now vanished.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You’re no longer worried about what career you’re gonna go into.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You stopped thinking about what to say to the girl you have a crush on.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And you couldn’t give a singular shit about the decor in home or clothes on your back.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You now have one goal;</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Survive.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you’re reading this, I assume that the Vietnamese are not currently trying to blow your head off.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">What a lucky guy (or girl) you are.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m in the same boat.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And although this is obviously a privilege, it comes with consequences.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Naturally, you want a war.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You want a mountain to climb, and a communist to shoot at.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But because life is relatively easy, you have to avoid the trap of getting caught up in bullshit problems so that you feel like you’re progressing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">In other words, don’t stress about inconsequential things because you don’t have a life or death thing.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You need to find your Vietnam war.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Actually, let me rephrase that.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You need to make your life the Vietnam war.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Build businesses, go hard in the gym, nurture beautiful relationships, get famous, fight a homeless man (lol), travel the globe…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Just do something.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Preferably something that’s actually productive instead of worrying about things that have little impact on your life.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">That’s how you avoid becoming a Karen who gets mad at kids for skateboarding on the sidewalk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Or becoming a fat incel whose only joy is yelling racial slurs at the TV.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Or even a manic 46 year old housewife who yells at the gardener because he missed a blade of grass.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You need real(er) problems.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Stuff that’s actually worth stressing about.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And you’re likely not gonna get sent to Vietnam any time soon so you have to bring Nam’ to you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You’re lucky.

Create an attractive, in-demand offer.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">2. Generate demand.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s actually the same process of building a club or restaurant, without the world of complexity attached to it.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">With an internet business, all you have to do is learn some skills and build the offer.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">That can take a week.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And basically costs nothing.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Once the offer is built, you can dedicate the majority of your focus to acquisition.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If your content gets attention, or you build a lucrative outbound system, or you can profitably put a dollar into Facebook and get $2 back, scaling becomes easy.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You double down on the acquisition system and you make sure nothing breaks on the backend.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Next thing you know, you have a $5m/year business that was built off a couple TikTok videos, loom pitches, or cringy ads.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Obviously I’m oversimplifying this a bit, but it really is this simple.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You lose when you try to make it more complicated.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you’re struggling to grow as a service provider or a coach, one of two things are happening.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">1. You’re focusing on the wrong things and distracting yourself from the actual needle movers.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">2. You’re just really dumb. No offense, but you are cooked. I think McDonalds is hiring though.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You might not realize it, but opportunity in the info-product space right now is similar to the way paid ads were 10-15 years ago.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I was in diapers back then, but a friend of mine told me he was getting 1 cent cost per click on his ads.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">1 cent.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Meaning, holy fuck, you’re gonna get rich.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But over time, that opportunity diminishes and it gets more expensive.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Right now, in 2024 you can whip out your phone and make a 48 second selfie video that millions of people could see.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If the content in the video is somewhat useful and you have an offer that correlates with it, you now have a seven figure business.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m not exaggerating.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Idiots are getting rich.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span><a href=\"https://go.benbader.com/the-artisan-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Do you want to join them?</span></a><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Talk tomorrow,</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\">​</p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>",

style=\"font-size:18px\">I just let housekeeping into my hotel room and am now homeless for the next 30 minutes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Should I join the crackheads that roam the streets of NYC?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Actually, I have a better idea.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The other day, someone asked me about my process for writing copy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">So this is an email about how to write an email.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you’ve been on this list for a while, you know that my style is a bit more casual than your average newsletter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Sometimes I ramble about random thoughts, other times I hash out an idea or concept, and every now and then I’ll send you a harder pitch for </span><a href=\"https://go.benbader.com/the-artisan-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Artisan Lab.</span></a>​</p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">No matter what, I have one goal in every line of copy I write.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And it’s to get you to read the next line.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Typically I start this by bringing you into my world.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is where I set the scene.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ll tell you where I am, what kind of state I’m in, and try to make you feel like you’re right here with me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s personal and casual style.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">My best emails seem to be when I describe an idea in a way that’s so detailed to where you feel like I’m articulating your own thoughts.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It creates this feeling where we’re solving a problem together.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Me and you against the world, baby.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is where I think I have a bit of an edge on your average copywriter.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Most end up talking down to their audience.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">They put themselves on this authoritative pedestal, and are so obsessed with “giving value” that it eradicates the value.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Because people hate being told what to do for no reason.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you tell someone why they should live a certain way or think a certain way, without giving them context as to how you arrived at that conclusion, you’re just preaching.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s the personal aspect and storytelling that makes the lessons hit.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If I tell you a story about how I overcame a fear and then connect the dots for you as to how you can do the same in your own life, that’s when it resonates.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Versus if I were to impose my own beliefs on you without providing any personal anecdotes, you’d have stopped reading by now.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You read my emails because I talk directly to you.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I don’t think about “providing value” because I know that if my email is personal enough, it becomes valuable.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Is this making sense?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I hope so.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m dying for a bacon egg and cheese here so I have to run, but the last thing I’ll leave you with is this:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You just have to trust yourself.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I often start these emails without any idea of what I’m going to say.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But I know that if I just begin writing, my subconscious brain starts to work for me.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It feeds me an analogy or story that I can use to articulate my point.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And by the time I get to the end, it ends up being pretty coherent (most of the time).</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ok I’m starving.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hope you enjoyed my email about emails, </span><a href=\"https://go.benbader.com/the-artisan-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span

Learn copywriting</strong></span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Read books, watch Youtube videos, and start writing sample copy. </span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You can improve quickly, you just have to get reps.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Writing on Twitter or pretending you have your own email list can also be helpful.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Study good copy and your subconscious will recognize patterns.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But DO NOT overthink this.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">You don’t have to be the best writer in the world, you just have to be competent.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>2. Start outreach</strong></span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Start before you feel 100% ready, as most learning is done on the fly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Go through social media, find people that are selling coaching and pitch them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Just don’t be an idiot and copy what everyone else tells you to do.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This part is a grind but the bar is low because everyone else is dumb.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you send a good pitch, you have a chance.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’ve literally sent one outbound pitch this entire year and it landed me a 5 figure deal.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>3. Just say yes</strong></span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you understand copywriting, learning other skills is easy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I could teach you how to write a VSL in 10 minutes.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Same with managing CRMs, automations, and literally any other relevant skill.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Just because you haven’t done something before doesn’t mean you’re not one Google search away.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you get an opportunity, take it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">That’s literally how I learned everything.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">A client would come to me with a need, I’d say “yes I can do that” and boom, I figured it out.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">It’s really that simple.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Just don’t get distracted along the way.</span></p><p class=\"\">​<a href=\"https://go.benbader.com/the-artisan-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">If you want my personal coaching in your own journey to wealth, go here.</span></a>​</p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Deuces,</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Ben</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">​<br/>​</span></p><p class=\"\">​</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",

style=\"font-size:18px\">I’m sitting outside with a large iced vanilla latte that has a bit too much milk in it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Let’s talk about risk.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Recently, one of my newest students in </span><a href=\"https://go.benbader.com/the-artisan-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Artisan Lab</span></a><span style=\"font-size:18px\"> got a client within 48 hours of joining.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He closed someone on a VSL script and funnel.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">As of right now, he has no idea how to do this.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">But he figured he’d close the deal anyway and use the resources inside my mastermind to learn what he needs on the fly.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">How irresponsible and misleading, right?</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Let’s weigh the potential outcomes here:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Best case scenario, he builds a solid VSL funnel (which should be easy because he has me as a resource) and the client is happy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">They continue working together and it makes him 5-6 figures over the next year.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Worst case scenario, he builds the worst funnel in the world, the client hates it and fires him.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">And then…</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">He goes back to the way his life was before.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Now with a rep under his belt, knowing what he needs to improve.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">That&#x27;s it.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Meaning the worst case scenario is still a win.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">This is how most “risks” actually work.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">They’re win-win situations, and the only way you lose is by not taking them.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">When you think critically about it, this is the rational way to operate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">A few years ago when I dropped out of college, here’s how I saw it:</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I could stay in school, get my degree and hope I find a job that makes me over $40k per year when I graduate.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">I’d be absolutely miserable but at least no one would look at me like I was crazy.</span></p><p class=\"\"><span

quickly I could write a VSL for a new offer using AI.</p><p class=\"\">I scrolled through Youtube until I found a creator who makes content about high ticket sales.</p><p class=\"\">She has under 1k subscribers but gets solid engagement on her videos and only began uploading a few months ago.</p><p class=\"\">This potentially would be a great client for a copywriter/info-agency owner for a few reasons:</p><p class=\"\">- High ticket sales is a validated niche and she innately has a unique mechanism in selling to women.</p><p class=\"\">- She’s newer to info and doesn’t have a full funnel built out yet.</p><p class=\"\">- She’s posting consistent content and her personal brand is growing.</p><p class=\"\">So here’s where the experiment began:</p><p class=\"\">I copied the links of her existing YT videos and put them into an AI software I’m gatekeeping for now (sorry).</p><p class=\"\">Then I uploaded a VSL framework for AI to reference.</p><p class=\"\">And I prompted it to write the VSL using the information in her videos based on the winning framework I gave it.</p><p class=\"\">30 seconds later, the script was done.</p><p class=\"\">After a few minor edits, my job would be completely finished.</p><p class=\"\">This is something that used to require hours of research and another hour or so to write.</p><p class=\"\">Now it can be effectively completed in under 5 minutes with the right AI tools and prompts.</p><p class=\"\">But here’s the catch…</p><p class=\"\">If you don’t know how to find good clients, what to say in your outreach, and you can’t articulate your value on a sales call, AI doesn’t help you.</p><p class=\"\">Sure you could use the same process I laid out and get a similar result.</p><p class=\"\">But you also need to be able to demonstrate a

Skill set</em></p><p class=\"\">This one’s the most obvious.</p><p class=\"\">Learn a skill that other people find valuable, trade that skill for money.</p><p class=\"\">This is the prerequisite.</p><p class=\"\">It’s the equivalent of a college degree in the entrepreneur world (except it actually means something).</p><p class=\"\">As you increase competency, you grow capable of solving bigger problems that pay better.</p><p class=\"\">Once this foundation is laid, the other two elements unlock…</p><p class=\"\"><em>2. Opportunity vehicle</em></p><p class=\"\">This is what you’re selling and who you’re selling to.</p><p class=\"\">The best marketer in the world will make no money if their clients are broke.</p><p class=\"\">On the contrary, apply your skill set the right way (in a growing industry where people are making lots of money) you’ll be paid in proportion.</p><p class=\"\">Nail these two, and money starts to rain.</p><p class=\"\">And then, there’s the third which makes everything click…</p><p class=\"\"><em>3. Influence</em></p><p class=\"\">This is who you know and who knows you.</p><p class=\"\">It could mean attention on social media or even just a network of the right people.</p><p class=\"\">That’s it.</p><p class=\"\">Skill, vehicle, influence.</p><p class=\"\">Master all three and business becomes unfairly easy.</p><p class=\"\">Ignore even one… and you’ll feel like you’re a stripper without rhythm. Or an ass.</p><p class=\"\">So here’s the move:</p><p class=\"\">Audit yourself.</p><p class=\"\">What’s missing?</p><p class=\"\">What’s the next smallest move to fix it?</p><p class=\"\">For me, working with course sellers was the unlock.</p><p class=\"\">Skillset? Check — copywriting and funnel building were finally being put to good use.</p><p class=\"\">Vehicle? Check — these creators had leverage, audience, and cash flow.</p><p class=\"\">Influence? Check — proximity to high-level operators opened more doors than I could count.</p><p class=\"\">It was the rare overlap of all 3 elements.</p><p class=\"\">And once I leaned in, everything changed.</p><p class=\"\">If you’re still trying to force something that doesn’t check all three boxes…</p><p class=\"\">​<a href=\"https://go.benbader.com/the-artisan-lab\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ck-link\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maybe it’s time to pivot.</a>​</p><p class=\"\">Ben</p><p class=\"\">​</p><p class=\"\">​</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",
