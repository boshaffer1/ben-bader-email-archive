    "body": "This is awkward. Not too long ago, I set out on this journey of sending an email every day for 100 days.\n\n Aaaand I haven't sent an email in 6 days.\n\n If I had a good excuse, I'd insert it [here].\n\n But I don't.\n\n Let's pretend like that didn't happen and carry on with day 10, okay?\n\n Okay.\n\n If you ever want to lose faith in humanity, get an apartment overlooking a busy road. I've witnessed 3 near accidents while pondering where I will take this email.\n\n My brain is fried from scrolling through tik tok all day. And writing for all of these different offers has confused me.\n\n I'm so adept at putting myself in a client's shoes and writing to their audience that I've lost touch with my voice.\n\n I've joked about this before, but I might be starting to develop schizophrenia.\n\n There are so many things I want to write abou– YOU NEED TO MAKE MONEY ONLINE, OR YOUR FAMILY HATES YOU, AND YOU'RE A WORTHLESS PIECE OF SCUM.\n\n Sorry, that was an alternate personality coming out. I didn't mean it.\n\n I wish no one actually read this thing. Because then I could share what I want without putting on a front.\n\n But I can't see who's on the other side of the screen. What if it's a potential client? Or someone who looks up to me? An acquaintance? A friend? A family member? (It's not a family member; I manually unsubscribed all of them).\n\n What if my reality doesn't live up to your inflated perception of me?\n\n Or maybe it's not inflated? Maybe you think I'm just some idiot kid, sporadically typing illegible sentences to you through the world wide web…\n\n This was supposed to be a safe space. One where I earn your trust by sharing the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\n I want to write like nobody's reading… maybe I'll keep this one in the archive forever.\n\n I'll write another email about how I generated a few hundred grand for my clients this week.\n\n That'll keep the readers happy. How cool, right? I'll tell them about the webinar and how amazing the Black Friday sale went…\n\n That's the email I'll share… definitely not this one. \n\n So now that it's just you and me, I'm glad we can talk.\n\n Because on the outside, you may see this 22-year-old kid who's got it figured out. He lives in Miami, has dope friends, makes money, travels, and builds cool shit (and he's insanely fucking handsome).\n\n But sometimes, on the inside, he feels like everything is crumbling…like he's faking it all…He thinks others are passing him, he'll never figure it out, and he bit off more than he can chew.\n\n Maybe that's why he hasn't sent an email in 6 days – Because he doesn't want them to know what he wants to say.\n\n Whenever he opens his laptop, he stares at a blinking cursor on a blank screen. He knows what he wants to write when he puts his fingers on the keyboard. But those thoughts vanish to protect this illusion he portrays.\n\n Now, this is all hypothetical, of course. I don't want you to think I'M saying any of these things. \n\n My life is actually perfect. And this journal entry will never actually see the light of day anyway.\n\n So I guess I'll start to wrap this up. Because I've got to write the email that I'm actually going to send today.\n\n I'm glad we had this chat, though - just the two of us.\n\n Just keep doing what you're doing, bro. You're on the right path… And you know no one really knows what they're doing? They're all just faking it too.\n\n Think about how far you've come. In another world, you're about to start looking for a $70k-a-year job out of college.\n\n Be grateful for where you are.\n\n Good talk.",

I thought to myself, “damn, I don’t think I’d ever be able to do that.”\n\n Now at age 22, I still can’t spin a pizza on my finger like my long-lost friend Mario.\n\n But I guarantee you that if I spent these last 11 years honing my pizza-spinning skills, I’d be whipping dough around my fingers like nobody’s business.\n\n I don’t actually remember his name but Mario just sounds right.\n\n Anyway, back to the point.\n\n I’m talking about this Kaizen principal because today marks day one of a long journey.\n\n One hundred days in a row of long-form writing.\n\n Why?\n\n Good question. I’m not sure what I’m gonna do with this or where I’ll share it. But if you’re reading this, I guess I figured it out.\n\n So I guess a hello is appropriate.\n\n I’m Ben.\n\n Right now, I’m sitting in my overpriced-but-somehow-worth-every-penny Herman Miller Aeron chair.\n\n It’s a quiet Thursday night here in my Miami skybox.\n\n My across-the-sky neighbor is on the couch in his living room playing call of duty again. It’s become a nightly ritual for us.\n\n I’ll watch him turn on COD around 8:33 pm and consequently wonder if anyone is watching me and writing about it on the internet.\n\n He just got a kill.\n\n I’m also toggling back and forth between this page and the Thursday night football game.\n\n I bet on the Falcons, and their deficit seems to increase every time I check. Down 13-0 at the moment.\n\n I just remembered what I wanted to talk to you about today. This idea came to me in the shower a few hours ago while I was thinking about one of the happiest periods of my life.\n\n It was around February to May 2021. I’d finally started making money online. Those first $3k, $5k, and $10k months were unforgettable.\n\n I was on top of the world. After all this time, I finally proved I could do it.\n\n But when I think back to those times, most of the highlights aren’t sexy.\n\n They’re the little moments of gratitude. Or the normally mundane mornings that I’ve colored with a nostalgic hue.\n\n I remember walking on the stair stepper at my college gym, wearing a ripped blue t-shirt, smiling like an idiot while typing away Tweets on the keyboard.\n\n It was my first $6k month, and I was rich. Not literally, but I would’ve been if wealth were measured in gratitude.\n\n There’s a collection of other minuscule moments I won’t bore you with a story behind, but this idea in and of itself is interesting.\n\n You probably have this grand vision for where you’d like to be in 6 months, a year, five years… but the scenes you imagine now probably won’t be what you appreciate when you get there.\n\n You’ll have fond memories of the beautiful blonde in the passenger seat of your Porsche 911, but the one that stands out isn’t picture-perfect.\n\n It’s the late-night fast food run where she spills her frosty on the seat, and you rip the t-shirt off your back to wipe it off before it seeps into the leather.\n\n It’s when you drop your potatoes and run out of the grocery store to your desk because you just had an idea that must be acted upon immediately.\n\n I don’t know if any of this made sense, but if you’re still reading this far along we’re probably on the same page (figuratively).\n\n It looks like my Call Of Duty-loving neighbor just called it a night and that’s my sign to do the same.\n\n Day 1 is down; 99 more to go.\n\n We’ll chat tomorrow if I don’t forget.\n\n - Ben",

I guess these are my Boron letters.\n\n Unless you write copy for a living, you probably don't get that reference, but it's okay. You don't need to.\n\n Today is 11/11/22. Apparently, it's a lucky day.\n\n After putting my net worth on black at the online roulette table, I beg to differ.\n\n Kidding.\n\n Speaking of great ways to waste money, I dropped out of college in January 2021. \n\n Twenty-two months later, my life looks a lot different.\n\n I've made a few hundred grand and generated a lot more for my clients by clicking buttons on the internet.\n\n Now I'm living in Miami with a circle of brothers that make me feel poor.\n\n One principle I can think of has been pivotal in my success.\n\n I'm trying not to sound like one of those dorks from Twitter who tells you to drink water and stop jerking your chicken.\n\n Hear me out.\n\n Delusional self-belief is the best trait you can adopt.\n\n You truly are the person you believe you are. Nearly everything can be trained and improved.\n\n If you don't like the person you see when you look at yourself in the mirror, you have all the power to do something about it.\n\n Having an unwavering sense of self will give you the confidence to take more risks. To burn the boats. And to be resilient.\n\n If there's one thing you do from reading this email, let it be this:\n\n Take out a piece of paper and describe in detail the person you want to be.\n\n What does he or she look like? What are their habits? How would their friends describe them?\n\n List out their character traits, the type of clothes they wear, and so on. This can be the \"you\" six months or six years from now. There's no right or wrong way to do this as long as you're detailed.\n\n Once that person is established, it's time to take the baton.\n\n Carry yourself the way that ideal version carries themself. Talk the way they talk. Think the way they think.\n\n Understand that nothing happens in the future. If you want to change, that change must happen NOW; this is how you do it.\n\n This is how you change your life.\n\n Aren't you glad you subscribed to this instead of some random girls only fans?\n\n Listen.\n\n This is how you reinvent yourself.\n\n It sounds corny, and it kind of is.\n\n But I went from basketball player to frat star, to idiot business owner, to less idiot business owner. And it's all because I chose the person I wanted to be and assumed that identity.\n\n Your reality is a conscious decision.\n\n You decide to put yourself in a box.\n\n You decide to let circumstances affect you.\n\n And you decide the lifestyle you live.\n\n Unsubscribe from the beliefs that no longer serve you.\n\n And unsubscribe from your exes only fans.\n\n ​\n\n Talk tomorrow,\n\n Ben\n\n ​",

My across-the-sky neighbor is enjoying the show with his girl.\n\n It’s not the COD-playing neighbor I wrote about in 001. I don’t think he has many friends. The dude on the floor above him is my homie, Clarence.\n\n We’ve never spoken, but he looks like his name is Clarence.\n\n We wave to each other while drinking morning coffee on our parallel balconies.\n\n I think he’s in ecom because he works on his laptop and I saw him taking product pics one time.\n\n Anyway, I wish you guys could see the view right now.\n\n I’d take a picture for you, but “some moments are best kept as memories.”\n\n A girl told me that while we were drinking wine on the beach looking up at the stars.\n\n I’m not sure if it was profound or if I just wanted to smash. She had pretty eyes.\n\n It’s a Saturday night and I’m leaning toward staying in.\n\n Many of my favorite nights are spent at my laptop with a ninety-dollar Diptyque candle on my desk. I’m either planning a road to $100 mil or gambling away my life savings at the roulette table. Never an in-between.\n\n Life’s too short to half-ass anything. But most people half-ass the entire thing.\n\n It’s easy to do when you were raised like me. Good family and never had to stress about food on the table, or bills being paid.\n\n Sounds like a pretty good upbringing, no?\n\n It is, but often times it leads to a mediocre life.\n\n Everything is too convenient. It’s easy to get a decent job and climb the corporate ladder.\n\n Why push for more?\n\n Just play it safe and you’ll never have to struggle.\n\n Easy times create weak men and weak men cut off their balls and dye their hair pink… or however the saying goes.\n\n To me, the most miserable existence of all is one where you never push all your chips to the middle.\n\n You never get to find out what you’re capable of when your back is against the wall.\n\n I’d rather lose everything than never try.\n\n You test yourself as a man. And like a sword, you come through the fire sharper than you were before.\n\n Run towards the things that scare you. The more resistance you feel, the more it means you need to do it.\n\n Unless you’re scared of fat bitches because I am too and I’m RUNNING away like the wind.\n\n I got stuck walking behind one today for 22.4 seconds. The longest 22.4 seconds of my life.\n\n This email just took a turn and if I keep going down this route I might end up in handcuffs.\n\n I’ll leave you with a quote from a movie that changed my life, Fight Club. eye-roll \n\n “I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who’ve ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s**t we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War’s a spiritual war… our Great Depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.”\n\n Thanks for reading today’s scatterbrained rant.\n\n Chat tomorrow fellow space monkey,\n\n Ben",

She does it out of love, and you take care of her.\n\n I wonder if this is how Zuckerberg felt when he got the idea for Facebook.\n\n Anyway, I sat in the sun for a while today, and it made me sleepy.\n\n Half of my body was in the shade, and now I look like the dude from Batman when he gets his face burned off.\n\n I'm gonna go to bed and hope that when I wake up tomorrow, it somehow evens out.\n\n Have a great week,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S.

I was in a Honda Civic. He was in a yellow Ferrari Pista. Safe to say I didn't win.\n\n Ok, back to the story.\n\n A lot of the book is just motivation porn, but for a 13-year-old with big dreams, it was my bible.\n\n In retrospect, one of the book's last lines made a lasting impact on me.\n\n \"Every dream you imagine, everything you see and hear and feel in your sleep, that's not a fantasy, that's your deep instinct telling you it can be all real. Follow those visions and dreams and desires and believe what you know. Only you can turn those dreams into reality. Never stop until you do.\"\n\n Gives me the chills to this day.\n\n When you ask a 9-year-old kid what they want to be when they grow up, they don't say investment banker. They don't say accountant. They don't say waiter. They don't say only fans model.\n\n But 12 years later, whatever goals they had have been beaten out of them.\n\n Makes me sad just talking about it, so I'm changing the topic.\n\n Today I learned that one of my (formerly) favorite gurus is kind of a scammer.\n\n Not a full scammer… he didn't hire an army of college kids to hand out fake parking tickets, set up a \"website\" where people go to pay, steal their card info and sell it on the black market.\n\n I had that idea after I got a parking ticket once. It's genius.\n\n Anyway, I watched this guy's Youtube videos in college and took a full 2-3 pages worth of notes on each video.\n\n I planned on going to his live events and maybe investing in his coaching one day.\n\n And today, I found out he sucks at his job.\n\n Want me to tell you who?\n\n You're probably on the edge of your seat right now.\n\n Let me tell you how I learned this. \n\n I was talking to a guy today who has over 450k followers on tik tok. He's in the dating niche, his content is good, and anyone in that position should be able to make AT LEAST $20k a month.\n\n Like bare minimum. Seriously.\n\n He's working with [redacted], who told him to make an 8-week coaching program and sell it entirely through the DM's. No sales calls.\n\n The course is only $300 and this poor guy is lucky when he gets more than 2 sales a month.\n\n Here's the worst part…\n\n [redacted] is charging him $2,500 a month for CONSULTING.\n\n The anonymous brain-dead monkey accounts on Twitter could help this guy more than [redacted] is.\n\n U N R E A L\n\n If you're still reading, reply with a guess of who you think the guru is, and I'll tell you if you're right or wrong.\n\n My eyes are getting tired and you're probably tired of reading the word [redacted] so I think we should end this.\n\n I have to sneeze.\n\n Much love,\n\n Ben\n\n ​",

    "body": "It’s 9:55 pm here in Brickell, and it’s one of those days where it’s a struggle to even get a sentence out on here.\n\n I legit had to rewrite that first line 8 times.\n\n This would be much easier in person because of days like this. I could just ask you a question and nod my head as if I’m listening.\n\n In college, I got pretty good at appearing interested in what people are saying without actually listening.\n\n After all, it’d make anyone go crazy listening to 26 variations of the same blonde girl explaining crystals and star signs.\n\n “Yes Jessica, I get it. When Sagittarius rises, the sun goes into retrosynthesis.”\n\n Imagine getting that same lecture every day.\n\n I had to tune it out for my own sanity.\n\n Over the past few days, I’ve started to notice how everything in my life is connected.\n\n When I’m consistent in the gym, I get more work done. When I write to you people, sad voice goes away.\n\n Action = Happy Ben.\n\n I’m envious of people that are able to have a horrible routine and still be incredibly productive.\n\n One of my friends embodies this to its core. I don’t want to name names, so we’ll call him “Eagle Jason.”\n\n Jason wakes up whenever he wants and scrolls on tik tok for an hour while puffing on his 4 pink puff-berry vapes.\n\n He rolls out of bed to go downstairs and get the venti skinny vanilla latte he just ordered on uber eats.\n\n Then he gets out his laptop and refreshes stripe. He’s already made more money today than most people will all month.\n\n Cardin– I mean, Eagle Jason is your anti-guru. The kid can do everything “wrong” and still operate at a level that most people can’t reach without a copious amount of stimulants.\n\n I learned 2 new things today.\n\n The word “vapious.” The geographical layout of America. I realized I had very little understanding of which state was which, so I started taking this online quiz.\n\n It gives you the name of a state, and you click the according location on the map.\n\n This little “ding” would sound when you got the answer correct, and that sound quickly became addicting.\n\n 2 hours later, I got 50/50 and started timing myself on how quickly I could complete it.\n\n I knew my friend Mason (crazy how close his name is to Jason, lol) would appreciate this tedious little game.\n\n So, I sent him the link, and about an hour later, we were racing each other to see who could complete the map quicker.\n\n This consumed my entire afternoon.\n\n My high score was 1 minute 24 seconds, and Mason’s was 1 minute 11 seconds. Kids got fucking speed.\n\n ​ Here’s the link if you’re also an autistic monkey that’s entertained by the simplest things.\n\n Listen to the song “Fortunate Son” by CCR for added effect.\n\n God bless America,\n\n Ben",

Apparently, the latter means “to reveal”\n\n It’s 10:36 pm, and I spent the last 22 minutes watching a Corvette C8 review on Youtube.\n\n My dopamine receptors get really fucked up every Wednesday because I watch my friend/client make an absurd amount of money in about an hour and a half on our weekly webinar.\n\n After the high of seeing the money come in so quickly, there’s this looming sense of emptiness afterward.\n\n Money is interesting.\n\n It’s not going to solve all of your problems.\n\n But it’s a problem that needs to be solved.\n\n And as you solve the money problem, your other problems will be solved.\n\n I know it sounds like I’m a homeless man babbling riddles to his imaginary best friend, so let me explain.\n\n In most cases, you have to become a very capable person to make a lot of money.\n\n A person that’s capable of critical thinking, showing poise under pressure, leading a team, etc.\n\n The type of person with the qualities I mentioned above is disciplined and rational, but valiant.\n\n See where this is going yet?\n\n Many qualities people lack before making money are earned in the process of making money.\n\n I don’t know if this is high-level insight or if I’m just really tired, so it sounds good, but I’m going to keep running with it.\n\n This is why the crypto dorks or lottery winners will end up doing some dumb shit and lose their money.\n\n I might’ve made this analogy a few emails ago, but it applies here, too, so forgive me:\n\n When you heat a sword in fire, it becomes malleable. Then you beat it with a hammer over and over, and eventually, its impurities are gone… Creating a much sharper than it was before.\n\n The moral of the story - burn lottery winners and crypto dorks and beat them with hammers.\n\n I’m tired.\n\n Goodnight.\n\n ( I know it’s not nighttime when you receive this email, so good morning or good afternoon too)\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

I had to write 4 emails, an entire sales page, and send a cold DM.\n\n After all that, I was left with only 3 or 4 hours to spare.\n\n You might be thinking, “isn’t that enough time to write a 400-word email?”\n\n Great question. And yes, it is.\n\n BUT here’s what happened. I decided to put a small $300 live bet on the Miami Heat to beat the Washington Wizards.\n\n After that didn’t hit, I went to the virtual roulette table to recoup my “investment,” where I found myself in a $1,500 hole.\n\n Now, if there’s one thing you know about me, it’s that I’m not a quitter. \n\n I dug myself all the way out of that hole and only ended down $400 on the day.\n\n As a celebration, I smoked a joint for the first time in a few months, and there was zero chance I was sitting down to write a coherent sentence after that.\n\n We’re back today, so thanks for your patience.\n\n It’s interesting how everyone has a story that they tell the world and another story that’s the real truth.\n\n I decided to commit to 100 days of writing long-form emails because I wanted to become a better writer…\n\n Kinda. That’s what I’ll tell you if you ask.\n\n But truly, I’m doing this for a few reasons.\n\n The first is discipline. If I can’t commit to sitting at my desk for 30 minutes a day and hitting random letters on my keyboard, I have bigger problems.\n\n The final reason (and the actual one behind the two cover-ups I just gave you) is to use this as an outlet to vent.\n\n If I go a while without pausing to check in with myself, I start to go crazy.\n\n My goal here is to break down the wall between who I present myself as to the world and what really goes on inside my head.\n\n But even now, I’m debating saying what I know is true vs what I want you to think.\n\n This is quite vague and scattered, and I assume I’ve lost most of you, so if you’re still with me I hope this made some sense.\n\n Talk tomorrow,\n\n Ben",

I’ve gotten almost everything on my to-do list done already, and it’s only 10:15 am.\n\n Who knew how much you could accomplish when you just sit down and work?\n\n I’d been meditating naked while praying to my David Goggins poster for the last 2 years, thinking THAT would make me a millionaire.\n\n Oh well, better later than never.\n\n Wait, why are you looking at me like I impregnated your Grandma?\n\n Do I have something on my fa– OHHH, you’re mad that I haven’t emailed you in months after telling you that I was gonna email you for 100 days straight.\n\n Aaaand to make it worse, I’m carrying on like nothing ever happened. Talk about an elephant in the room.\n\n This is probably how girlfriends feel when you do something they don’t like, but they don’t wanna tell you what it was.\n\n You know somethings wrong, and you keep asking her, “bb, what’s wrong” and she says, “nothinngggg” but the tone gets angrier every time you ask.\n\n And then, FINALLY she cracks and tells you what’s pissing her off.\n\n Turns out she’s mad that you got her whole milk instead of oat milk in her iced latte… Yup, been there too man.\n\n Ok, sorry I'm deflecting.\n\n You see, what really happened is I’ve accidentally been sending to the wrong segment. So we’re actually on day 74 of the 100-day email challenge, and you just haven’t been getting the emails! Haha!\n\n Ok, you’re right that’s BS. Stop looking at me like that… FINE! I committed to writing an email every day for 100 days, and I quit on day 9. I said it. Happy now?\n\n A lot has changed since we last spoke.\n\n First and most importantly, I got a Nespresso machine. I’m actually sitting on my balcony with a burnt tongue, still managing to sip down this latte.\n\n Second, I bought a toy.\n\n It’s black and german (pause).\n\n Yes, I’m talking about an Audi RS5. And don’t forget the R or the S. Because that means racing sport. And it signifies that I’m better than all the other wagie cucks that drive around in A5s or S5s.\n\n I didn’t really post it on Twitter (like everyone else when they get their first nice car) because I wanted to feel like I was better than everyone.\n\n It sounds cooler to buy it and keep it private, right? Like, oh, not a big deal at all that I spent more money on a hunk of metal than what I would’ve made annually with a job out of college.\n\n Not that that’s super impressive… I imagine most Communications majors from the College of Charleston end up dying their hair pink and making frappuccinos' for a living.\n\n I’m buying another toy today too, actually. It’s a lot smaller and about 1/5th the price.\n\n I’ll show you tomorrow on the rare chance that I actually send another email this quarter.\n\n Anyone wanna take a side bet? Live odds for me sending an email tomorrow are about +800.\n\n But hey, if you read all the way to here, hit reply and let me know. I thrive off validation from strangers behind a screen, and if enough of you [redacted] reply, maybe I’ll keep this train going.\n\n GREAT catching up with you {{ subscriber.first_name }}.\n\n Talk tomorrow for +800 :)\n\n Ben\n​",

But because I want your money.\n\n All of these people that you see online are making a FUCK TON of money, and I’m only getting % of it.\n\n I want the whole pie.\n\n So I decided that I’m gonna start taking this newsletter more seriously and sell you some bullshit Dan Koe/ Dickie Bush style writing course.\n\n Not to hate on either of them because they’re both great. And they’re really good at organizing notions.\n\n Anyway, I worked with a guy recently who had a really hot assistant. It was clear she was only on the team because she was hot, but boy was that a great idea.\n\n When you’re in the presence of an attractive female, everyone brings their A-Game. And it’s completely sub-conscious.\n\n And just imagine being a client trying to fire me, and some bimbo barbie gets on the call and says, “noooo don’t go, John. I know we spent $104,000 last month and we only made you $2,400 back, but think about all the fun we’ve had. We’re meant to be.”\n\n The original “client retention hack.” Not that any of your favorite Twitter dorks keep clients for longer than a few months anyway.\n\n Oh yeah, back to my writing course.\n\n I think the first module will be able how to write concisely, and never get sidetracked. Because CLEARLY, I’m very good at that.\n\n Also Mason, if you’re reading this, don’t worry. It’s not gonna compete with Copy MBA (it’s gonna be way better).\n\n But you, {{ subscriber.first_name }}, should go click that link and buy it because I get a %.\n\n Didn’t think this email would turn into a promo for one of my friends' courses, but here we are.\n\n On that note, time for me to ask chat GPT to tuck me in and read me a bedtime story because I’m calling it a night.\n\n Live odds I email you tomorrow are +1100. Reply to put in your bet.\n\n Night,\n\n Ben",

Pleasure to have you.\n\nI'll fill you in real quick.\n\nOn November 10th, 2022, I set out to write a daily email to my subscribers for 100 days straight.\n\nToday marks day 116 in a row.\n\nCrazy right?\n\nI've written an email every day for the last 116 days, which is even more than I originally set out to do. You should feel horrible about yourself.\n\nOnly the thing is, today is day 14.\n\nI took a long hiatus after day 9 and have been writing a few emails a week for the last week or so. Consider me your fun uncle. Sometimes I disappear for while but when I'm around it's a great time.\n\nNow that you're all caught up let's get down to business…\n\nIn college, I used to take chops a few nights a week.\n\nIf you don't know what a chop is, it's when you put weed and tobacco in a bong and clear it in one hit.\n\nIt's the craziest head rush a few dollars worth of weed and a fifth of a light blue American Spirit can buy.\n\nThe thing about chops is they're not entirely pleasant.\n\nYou usually start spinning and feel like you're gonna throw up. Or you end up drooling all over yourself.\n\nBut if you can get over that phase, the buzz is completely and utterly unmatched.\n\nImagine all of the lights in your brain just shutting off for a fleeting moment.

Kind of tired of doing the same thing everyday and I'm ready to get out of here.\"\n\nMany of my friends are about to graduate.\n\nThey think the new experience of getting a job and moving to a different city will paint their life with excitement.\n\nAnd it might for a little bit.\n\nBut in a couple years that new routine and new city will once again become mundane and they'll tell themself the same old lie that they just need to change their environment.\n\nThey refuse to ever consider the possibility that the circumstances are not the problem.\n\nThey are the problem.\n\nYou're probably the problem in your own life too.\n\nI know I am.\n\nI was addicted to basketball from the age of 9 to 17.\n\nI was sneaking into the gym to workout, always watching film, I even bought a mental performance course from a guy named Taylor Allan.\n\nBut all that work I put in never really showed in games.\n\nI was a decent player, I started my junior and senior seasons in high school, but I never dominated the way I knew I could've.\n\nAnd there was always an excuse.\n\nMy coach wouldn't let me play the way I wanted, my teammates didn't work together, my shoes felt weird, I was hungry, the defender kept grabbing me, etc…\n\nThere's one constant variable here and it was me.\n\nI was the problem.\n\nI couldn't get out of my own head and just play.\n\nMost of what you want lies on the other side of getting out of your own way.\n\nStop blaming anything and everything that you're not where you want to be.\n\nAnd don't buy a Herman Miller chair just because your favorite guru has one.\n\nLove you,\n\nBen",

    "body": "Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }}, how was your day?\n\n Mine was good too.\n\n When I was in the shower earlier I realized that the thousand dollar Herman Miller chair I’m sitting in right now was kind of a scam.\n\n Sure it’s kinda comfy.\n\n It looks okay.\n\n But the only reason people rave about these chairs is because they’re expensive and other people like them.\n\n So I got placeboo’d into liking it too because I didn’t want to be the odd one out.\n\n Oops.\n\n Anyway, any chance you’re an accountant {{ subscriber.first_name }}?\n\n I’ve been needing to submit a bunch of income statements and other docs to one of the 2 accountants I’ve been leading on during this tax season.\n\n But I really don’t feel like doing it, so it’s sat on my daily to-do list every day for the last 3 months.\n\n Maybe I can just opt out???\n\n Guess we’ll find out.\n\n Switching gears again - you know you’re growing when you’re able to look back at yourself 3-6 months ago and you kind of cringe.\n\n You think about how naive you were, how you were less confident, and the silly things you might’ve been stressing about.\n\n Over the weekend I was back in the city I went to college in.\n\n When I’d ask people what’s new in their life, nearly all of their responses would go as follows:\n\n “Not too much man… same old. Kind of tired of doing the same thing everyday and I’m ready to get out of here.”\n\n Many of my friends are about to graduate.\n\n They think the new experience of getting a job and moving to a different city will paint their life with excitement.\n\n And it might for a little bit.\n\n But in a couple years that new routine and new city will once again become mundane and they’ll tell themself the same old lie that they just need to change their environment.\n\n They refuse to ever consider the possibility that the circumstances are not the problem.\n\n They are the problem. \n\n You’re probably the problem in your own life too.\n\n I know I am.\n\n I was addicted to basketball from the age of 9 to 17.\n\n I was sneaking into the gym to workout, always watching film, I even bought a mental performance course from a guy named Taylor Alan.\n\n But all that work I put in never really showed in games.\n\n I was a decent player, I started my junior and senior seasons in high school, but I never dominated the way I knew I could’ve.\n\n And there was always an excuse.\n\n My coach wouldn’t let me play the way I wanted, my teammates didn’t work together, my shoes felt weird, I was hungry, the defender kept grabbing me, etc…\n\n There’s one constant variable here and it was me.\n\n I was the problem.\n\n I couldn’t get out of my own head and just play.\n\n Most of what you want lies on the other side of getting out of your own way.\n\n Stop blaming anything and everything that you’re not where you want to be.\n\n And don’t buy a Herman Miller chair just because your favorite guru has one.\n\n Love you,\n\n Ben",

    "body": "I was in a state of constant unease . I was going in the wrong direction but didn’t know where else to turn… I was completely lost. \n\n I’m sitting in my childhood bedroom as I pull out my computer and start typing.\n\n For the last 6 months, I’ve been pretending to be someone I’m not.\n\n I’ve gotten so good at acting like I’m happy to the point that I’m starting to forget what it actually feels like.\n\n My fingers hit the keyboard as I write,\n\n “Never in my life have I felt this lost. I have always had something that I’m working toward, with an end goal in sight. This made it easy to get up every day and spend most of my time doing things that I thought would bring me closer to that goal. But what happens now?”\n\n I wrote this in January 2020 while on winter break, after finishing my first semester of college with a 1.1 GPA.\n\n About a year later, I got my first paying client for my lead gen “agency” - a basketball trainer in Long Island.\n\n Over the next 12 months, I built my brand as a marketer in the basketball training space when a trainer with a big personal brand asked me if I could help him sell his online products.\n\n I’d only run Facebook ads for local basketball training businesses at the time, a completely different (& easier) game than marketing for info-products.\n\n So naturally I said, “Sure, of course I can help. I’m an expert!” \n\n I started running his Facebook ads, writing emails, and building funnels for him.\n\n And although I had little idea what I was doing…\n\n It worked. \n\n I’d made him a few hundred grand over the next 6 months, which was a big win considering he had almost zero prior success with online training.\n\n This led me to start working with 3 of the other big personal brands in the space, and it’s how I learned the ins and outs of paid ads, copywriting, and all things info-product related.\n\n After a while, I started taking on clients outside of the bball niche.\n\n My first big wins for clients came through webinars and offer launches.\n\n Because I’ve built a versatile skillset, the scope of work changes from client to client, but in most cases, I built out a new funnel for a client, script their VSL or webinar, and then help them launch the offer to their email list & on socials.\n\n Depending on the offer and size of their personal brand, we may start running paid ads if it seems like a good fit after the initial launch.\n\n Most of my deals consist of an upfront investment anywhere from $5k - $15k and then around 10% of the revenue we generate.\n\n A year ago, my biggest client paid me $2,000 per month.\n\n Today, I’ve had singular clients pay me over $20,000 in a month.\n\n All because:\n\n I stopped working with broke people.

What’s the Ben Bader story?\r\n\r\nI figured I’d start here to help anyone that’s new get caught up.\r\n\r\nLong story that I don’t have the mental capacity to recite. I’m\r\n22 (and still waiting for my brain to fully develop). Here are\r\nsome recent highlights:\r\n\r\n- Dropped out of College of Charleston after 2 years.\r\n\r\n- Made my first $100k with a marketing agency for basketball\r\ntrainers.\r\n\r\n- Transitioned to info-products, and now I help big personal\r\nbrands and “influencers” make more money with their courses and\r\ncoaching.\r\n\r\n- Now living in Miami high rise with a bunch of other idiot\r\nmonkeys that make a lot of money.\r\n\r\n- I also am severely addicted to Zyns.\r\n\r\n2. How do you find clients to work for?\r\n\r\nI talk shit on Twitter and have built a bit of a brand there. I\r\nshare results, and people come to me inbound.\r\n\r\nI also get a lot of referrals and work with my close friends.\r\n\r\n3. Since you can work from anywhere, why Miami? Long-term to\r\nstay there or move somewhere else, or even buy a second\r\nhome/apartment somewhere?\r\n\r\nAll of my friends are here. Good weather. Parents have a condo an\r\nhour and a half north. Great place to meet other young\r\nentrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nI'll likely be in South Florida for a while… not sure how long\r\nit’ll be Miami.\r\n\r\nDon’t think I’d get a second place any time soon unless it were\r\nnecessary for biz, or I fall in love with some random girl that\r\nlives in bumble fuck Idaho or something lol.\r\n\r\n4. If you were 19 years old and trying to get to $10-15k a month\r\nas quickly as possible, what would you do?\r\n\r\nIf female: OnlyFans.\r\n\r\nIf male: Learn a high-value skill, pitch a fuck ton of people,\r\nget a client, repeat.\r\n\r\nIt’s really that simple.\r\n\r\nSend enough cold messages, connect with enough people, and hack\r\nyour way into different groups… you’ll find clients. You just\r\ngotta look hard enough.\r\n\r\n5. When you think about yourself 10 years in the past or 50 years\r\nin the future, does that feel like “Ben at a different time” or\r\n“This is a totally different person”?\r\n\r\nBen at a different time.\r\n\r\nI thought differently.\r\n\r\nI operated differently.\r\n\r\nI had a different self-identity.\r\n\r\nBut at the end of the day, the current me was in there all along.\r\n\r\nOkay, enough writing.\r\n\r\nThere actually were a few other decent questions, but this email\r\nis already getting too long. So if I didn’t answer you, don’t\r\ntake it to heart.\r\n\r\nBlame your fellow subscribers, actually. They have the attention\r\nspan of a gnat, so I know I’ll lose them if I keep rambling.\r\n\r\nIf you guys liked this lmk, I’ll make this Q&A a weekly thing.\r\n\r\nLove you Bo,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Keep it up, Ben!” \n\n The liberal-wagie-cuck army on tik tok is starting to get to me. \n\n I’ve had a couple of videos go semi *viral* recently, and half of my comments are people calling me a trust fund baby. \n\n The other half are girls commenting on my eyelashes. \n\n Fuck off woman, no I don’t have a “lash tech,” and if I did, I wouldn’t refer you to them. \n\n And to be fair, I did grow up in a great neighborhood, but every dollar I’ve made has been on my own. \n\n I actively tell my parents and grandparents that I don’t want their money. \n\n Business is going swimmingly right now. \n\n Clients are crushing, and I’m getting close to being out of poverty (I can taste $100k a month). \n\n But in all honesty, it feels a bit dull. \n\n An extra $20k per month or so wouldn’t change much about my life right now. \n\n Recently I’ve realized that money loses its value if you don’t utilize it. \n\n My life now looks cool, but I was going out more and having more “fun” when I was making around $10k per month, living like a rockstar in a college town. \n\n My favorite thing I’ve been able to do recently is impact people around me. \n\n Roughly 6 months ago, this 18-year-old kid found me on social media and asked me to mentor him by sending me a dollar on Venmo. \n\n I had some money sitting in my Venmo account, and I sent him $1k back. \n\n Phillip used that money to buy a course from a friend of mine and is now making $10k a month in sales. \n\n He’s moving out of his parent's house next month. \n\n Another dude who I call Scooby, has been replying to my emails updating me on his life. \n\n He was in a tough situation, so my friend Mason and I bought him a laptop to help him start making money online (love you scooby). \n\n One of my best friends from college, Stevie, was born to be in sales. \n\n This guy could make a brick wall laugh. \n\n I helped him get into a great opportunity, and he closed his first deal (and made $500 in commission) today. \n\n These 3 situations are some of the highest ROI things I’ve been able to experience recently, and they have nothing to do with me personally making more money. \n\n Funny how that works. \n\n Being a catalyst to help other people grow is really fucking cool. \n\n Sorry for the jumpiness in this email, I guess the zyn worked. \n\n Love you {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Ben",

Remember when you did XYZ even though you were nervous?” \n\n When you stop relying on confidence, you’ll no longer need it. \n\n Because no amount of inner work – no amount of money – no fancy watch will magically turn you into someone that you’re not right now. \n\n Only actions can do that. \n\n Last point to drive this home: \n\n Every star basketball player has bad games. \n\n There were times when Kobe would go 3/14 throughout a game. \n\n He literally holds the NBA record for the worst single-game shooting percentage when taking 5+ shots. \n\n Yet he still wants the ball in his hands with one minute to go… no matter how the previous 47 minutes have gone. \n\n Not because he’s feeling extra confident to step up to the plate that day. \n\n But because in his world, confidence doesn’t exist. \n\n It doesn’t matter. \n\n And he doesn’t need it because he replaced it with courage. \n\n Rip Kobe. Makes me sad just thinking about it. \n\n Anyway, I’m not gonna send this email. \n\n Instead, I’ll write a less personal email that makes me look like a perfect, confident person. \n\n If you received this, no, you didn’t. \n\n Miss her man, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Good article that Kobe wrote about obsession ​ \n\n P.S.S. Chat GPT graded my email a 7/10 because I spelled woman with two O’s, and “impregnate this pretty stranger” wasn’t professional. Fukk you, Chat GPT \n\n ​",

And if no one gets through it, no one will buy. \n\n This leads me to my second point… \n\n 2 - Reading good copy \n\n You’re already subscribed to the best newsletter in the world (mine). \n\n Why not add a few more? \n\n Seeing different writing styles and the way various arguments are made will help you be more creative in your own writing. \n\n Any time you see a good ad, sales page, email, etc. – save it. \n\n I have a folder with 200+ funnels on my bookmarks tab. \n\n I suggest you start to build one of your own. \n\n Last and final point… \n\n 3 - Thinking & doing other shit \n\n Many of my best realizations and ideas have come while doing something that isn’t writing. \n\n One time I basically wrote an entire sales page in my head while I was at the gym. \n\n I got home, and I just transcribed my brain onto a doc. \n\n You need to give your mind quiet time to think. \n\n The more you understand yourself and the way you operate – the more you’ll understand the world. \n\n And a vast array of experience will give you a wider perspective which translates to you being a better writer. \n\n Alrighty, this was a lot easier today. \n\n If you actually implement anything I told you to in this email - you’ll become a better writer. \n\n Thanks for reading, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Here’s a 3-minute info-product marketing masterclass for you ​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "Every Sunday, I go for a ~2-mile run around this riverwalk close to my apartment. \n\n To be clear – I’m not an apple-watch-wearing cardio dork. \n\n But I enjoy getting out in the sun, and running provides a great opportunity to fight the voice in my head that wants to be lazy. \n\n So today, I threw on my running shoes and went over to the path. \n\n It’s almost always crowded, so I’ve made it a competition in my head when I see other runners in front of me. \n\n My pace fluctuates a bit when I’m more motivated or going downhill versus uphill. \n\n But there are two scenarios where I drastically increase my speed. \n\n When I see someone in front of me, I turn on the jets. \n\n I try to run by them as fast as I can, so they feel bad about themselves they decide to stop running altogether (this is my attempt to make the riverwalk less crowded). \n\n On my way home today, I was coming up on this big intersection. \n\n Usually, it takes about 25 seconds to walk across. \n\n By the time I got up there, the countdown signal to cross the street was down to 4 seconds. \n\n I had two options… \n\n One - Stop and wait 2 minutes for the lights to turn red again. \n\n Or two - Hit the gas. \n\n I put my head down and ran faster than I had all day. \n\n If I didn’t, maybe I would've ended up on someone's windshield based on how aggressive drivers can be in Miami. \n\n My point – I ran the fastest when I absolutely had to. \n\n Faster than when I’m tracking down another runner. \n\n And faster than when I feel more motivated. \n\n Because nothing can induce speed the way necessity will. \n\n If you emptied your bank account and had to make a certain amount of money, or you’d be homeless in 30 days – you’d figure out a way to get it done. \n\n At that point, motivation doesn’t matter, it’s just a buzzword. \n\n It’s easy to take action when you have no other option, but it gets harder once you’ve had some success. \n\n Let’s say you’re making decent money with X business model. \n\n You want to pursue Y business model, but right now, X is paying for your lifestyle. \n\n What I’ve done, and perhaps the practically “sound” decision, is to start Y on the side while maintaining X. \n\n Once you’re making good money with Y, you transition into doing it full-time. \n\n Logically it makes sense – but here’s where it gets dangerous. \n\n If there's an idea that’s been on your mind for a while and you haven’t acted on it yet, it could be because your current situation offers you too much comfort. \n\n And if that idea lingers for long enough without the according action, it’ll drive you crazy. \n\n Maybe that’s when you consider burning the boats. \n\n ​ You’ll figure out how to swim when you’re in the water. ​ \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I’ve made my clients millions of dollars online, and I don’t know the difference between a metaphor and an analogy. I thought this running story was an analogy, but Chat GPT told me it was a metaphor. Maybe AI will replace us.\n\n P.P.S reply if you liked this email <3\n\n ​\n​",

You’re constantly thinking about them, and they're going to happen no matter what. \n\n But you also have a laundry list of the things that you kinda want. \n\n Maybe you kinda want to get jacked, take surfing lessons, learn guitar, go on more dates, start a YT channel, etc. \n\n These unclosed loops become death by 1,000 papercuts. \n\n They linger in the back of your head like a gnat that only bothers you occasionally. \n\n Most of the time, you’re not thinking about it, but when it’s buzzing in your ear, you want nothing more than to kill it. \n\n And in life, you’ll get occasional reminders about your “kinda wants” to the point where you’ll eventually need to start tackling them. \n\n They could be completely unrelated to your main thing (the things you can’t not do) and feel like a pointless side quest. \n\n But if they continue to linger, it means there’s something there. \n\n It’s an urge you have to quench. \n\n All this said, I likely won’t be getting a new TV until September 10th (first day of the Bengals football season). \n\n Don’t be like me. \n\n Start attacking one thing that you kinda want today. \n\n ​ And follow me on Twitter plz, ​ \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

Good movie about a dog that I watched the other night ​\n\n ​",

You’ll simply be selling more services to someone that\r\nalready trusts you.”\r\n\r\nThis is where I’d use language that shows you how I was once in\r\ntheir shoes and transfer my certainty into their soul (if I can\r\ndo it, you can do it).\r\n\r\nThis is how successful offers are created.\r\n\r\nSell an audience on a mechanism (business model), sell them on\r\nyourself as the authority, and sell them on themselves so they\r\ncan actually visualize their own success.\r\n\r\nHope this gave you a better understanding of how to extract money\r\nfrom strangers on the internet.\r\n\r\nReply if you liked it :)\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

I dropped out of school for a reason. \n\n Okay, I’m stalling now. \n\n What should I write to you about? \n\n Uhhh. \n\n I’ve been thinking about putting together a course or coaching offer for a while now. \n\n I keep going back and forth on what I’d offer, how hands-on it’d be, and what people want to learn from me. \n\n If I built an agency coaching offer, here’s how I’d position it: \n\n I’d start by demonizing the traditional SMMA model. \n\n You may have heard the saying, “An enemy of my enemy is a friend of mine.” \n\n This common enemy tactic is one of the most powerful tools you can use as a marketer. \n\n You’re breaking the beliefs of your audience while simultaneously building a bridge to your solution. \n\n This is how I’d sell you on the “full-stack marketer” business model. \n\n I’d show you how it’s easier to get a few clients to pay you $5k-$10k+ per month rather than try to stack a bunch of clients on cheap retainers and constantly have to do outreach. \n\n I’d tell you how I worked with 50+ clients that paid me $1k per month and how much of a headache that was. \n\n And I’d show you how I now get paid $10k- $30k per month (per client) without needing a huge team. \n\n With enough social proof and personal stories, I’d sell you on the business model, and I’d sell you on me. \n\n Now it’s time to sell you on you. \n\n This offer would be for people that have a client or two as a freelancer, so I’d speak directly to that archetype. \n\n “Since you already have some results, this is the easiest way to scale. You’ll simply be selling more services to someone that already trusts you.” \n\n This is where I’d use language that shows you how I was once in their shoes and transfer my certainty into their soul (if I can do it, you can do it). \n\n This is how successful offers are created. \n\n Sell an audience on a mechanism (business model), sell them on yourself as the authority, and sell them on themselves so they can actually visualize their own success. \n\n Hope this gave you a better understanding of how to extract money from strangers on the internet. \n\n Reply if you liked it :) \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. It's a miracle I finished this email without peeing my pants. You're welcome. \n\n ​",

    "body": "I often make fun of the dudes who constantly preach gratitude. \n\n It can sound ingenuine as if they’re talking about how grateful or how “at peace” they are as a way to make themselves feel better than others, which couldn’t be more hypocritical. \n\n It’s similar to those who use their belief and connection to God as a way to prop up their ego. \n\n But there comes a time when gratitude stares you back in the face as the only answer. \n\n You’ll go and get everything you previously dreamt of, and it won’t feel the way you anticipated. \n\n How many times can you go through this process until you realize that you’re chasing your own tail? \n\n Considering this is a topic I’ve written about frequently, the answer to the question above is obvious. \n\n The truth is, you will always want more. \n\n There’s always gonna be another mountain to climb, hoops to jump through, and levels to ascend to. \n\n And that’s okay – as long as you accept it. \n\n Acceptance is another thing that’s been on my mind recently. \n\n Everything you do is a choice that you make. \n\n Where you are right now, your habits, and your beliefs about yourself are all decisions that can be traced back to no one but you. \n\n Unease comes from the lies that you tell yourself about your desires. \n\n You say you want to change, but your actions do not correlate with change. \n\n When your actions fail to follow suit with the things you claim to want, it creates a disconnect between your actual reality and your desired reality. \n\n And that’s where unhappiness stems from. \n\n Pause for a second and audit your current situation in life. \n\n Consider your goals, routine, and beliefs. \n\n Would the previous version of you from a year, 2 years, or 5 years ago be ecstatic? \n\n Good. You have a lot to be grateful for. \n\n But it’s also likely that you’re currently holding some desires that are causing you anxiety because your actions do not align with them. \n\n It’s okay that you want more – just ensure that you’re taking the necessary action to fulfill those desires. \n\n Enough rambling for today. \n\n Hope this was semi-coherent, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "Whatever your expectations are as you open this email, lower\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI’m half asleep, but I can’t miss today as I was just starting to\r\nrebuild momentum with these.\r\n\r\nA few things I’ve been thinking about recently:\r\n\r\n1: Do girls drink water?\r\n\r\nI swear any time I’m with a girl, they will not drink unless I\r\nbasically force them to. It makes me wonder how they operate on\r\ntheir own and if they just go throughout their day without water.\r\n\r\n2: We are hard-wired to be obsessed.\r\n\r\nIf you’re smart, you get obsessed with something that brings you\r\nfulfillment and makes you money.\r\n\r\nYour purpose is to find the things that are worth obsessing over\r\nfor you and carry them out to their fullest potential.\r\n\r\nThis is where you find the flow state.\r\n\r\n3: I’m (probably) not smarter than you.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I see people comment on my videos or reply to my\r\nemails saying things like, “How are you so wise for being this\r\nyoung?”\r\n\r\nThe answer is that I trust myself. I’ve developed enough\r\nconviction in my own perception of the human experience that\r\nseems to resonate with others.

I like the\r\never-present blue tint in the air.\r\n\r\n“It would be impossible to be unhappy living here.” I think.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s when I stop and catch myself.\r\n\r\nI already live in paradise.\r\n\r\nMinus the aesthetic of the hills and homelessness, Miami is\r\nbasically the same thing.\r\n\r\nAnd I’m not unhappy in Miami at all – I’ve absolutely loved it\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\nBut that thought of “better” still crept in.\r\n\r\nThat singular thought has the potential to be cancerous.\r\n\r\nImagine you’re dating your dream girl (or dream man if you're a\r\ngirl).\r\n\r\nShe’s gorgeous in that unique, innocent way that you just don’t\r\nsee every day.\r\n\r\nYou guys get along perfectly. She’s clever, she can banter with\r\nyou, and most of the time, you know what she’s thinking before a\r\nword comes out of her mouth.\r\n\r\nIt’s that kind of chemistry that makes other couples fight after\r\nseeing you out because it makes them question the depth of their\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nBut one day, you start to develop eyes for a different girl.\r\n\r\nShe’s equally beautiful, and you’re intrigued. So you start\r\nfantasizing about girl number 2.\r\n\r\n“What would life be like with her? I bet she wouldn’t get mad at\r\nme for leaving the toilet seat up the same way my girl does.”\r\n\r\nAnd here comes the poison.\r\n\r\nYou start observing your girl in a different light.\r\n\r\nThe things you loved about her begin losing their luster.\r\n\r\nYou think more and more about what she does wrong and what you\r\ndon’t like about her.\r\n\r\nOver time, your relationship is silently in shambles. Neither of\r\nyou have acknowledged it yet, but you’ve been fighting way more\r\nabout little things.\r\n\r\nYou’re no longer the person she fell in love with, and you’ve\r\nwarped your perception of her to the point where you think she’s\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\nEventually, it all goes up in flames, and you find your way to\r\ngirl number 2.\r\n\r\nExcept she’s not just number 2.\r\n\r\nYou’ve ben doing this countless times with nearly everything in\r\nyour life.\r\n\r\nYou get what you want, and stop watering your own grass.\r\n\r\nYou slowly poison it, evade to the next one, and start all over.\r\n\r\nThis is a vicious cycle – Water your own grass and be careful of\r\nthese thoughts that there is always something better.\r\n\r\nThey will sprout quickly, and soon enough, you’ll live in a\r\nforest full of poison.\r\n\r\nAvoid looking for problems where there are none – because you\r\nwill find what you seek.\r\n\r\nThe grass is always (and never) greener when you fail to water\r\nyour own,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "I’m walking on the sidewalk in Beverly Hills, looking up at the beauty of the trees and surrounding scenery. \n\n It’s 75 degrees and sunny, with no wind and not a cloud in the sky. \n\n I like the way California license plates look. I like the ever-present blue tint in the air. \n\n “It would be impossible to be unhappy living here.” I think. \n\n And that’s when I stop and catch myself. \n\n I already live in paradise. \n\n Minus the aesthetic of the hills and homelessness, Miami is basically the same thing. \n\n And I’m not unhappy in Miami at all – I’ve absolutely loved it recently. \n\n But that thought of “better” still crept in. \n\n That singular thought has the potential to be cancerous. \n\n Imagine you’re dating your dream girl (or dream man if you're a girl). \n\n She’s gorgeous in that unique, innocent way that you just don’t see every day. \n\n You guys get along perfectly. She’s clever, she can banter with you, and most of the time, you know what she’s thinking before a word comes out of her mouth. \n\n It’s that kind of chemistry that makes other couples fight after seeing you out because it makes them question the depth of their relationship. \n\n But one day, you start to develop eyes for a different girl. \n\n She’s equally beautiful, and you’re intrigued. So you start fantasizing about girl number 2. \n\n “What would life be like with her? I bet she wouldn’t get mad at me for leaving the toilet seat up the same way my girl does.” \n\n And here comes the poison. \n\n You start observing your girl in a different light. \n\n The things you loved about her begin losing their luster. \n\n You think more and more about what she does wrong and what you don’t like about her. \n\n Over time, your relationship is silently in shambles. Neither of you have acknowledged it yet, but you’ve been fighting way more about little things. \n\n You’re no longer the person she fell in love with, and you’ve warped your perception of her to the point where you think she’s the problem. \n\n Eventually, it all goes up in flames, and you find your way to girl number 2. \n\n Except she’s not just number 2. \n\n You’ve ben doing this countless times with nearly everything in your life. \n\n You get what you want, and stop watering your own grass. \n\n You slowly poison it, evade to the next one, and start all over. \n\n This is a vicious cycle – Water your own grass and be careful of these thoughts that there is always something better. \n\n They will sprout quickly, and soon enough, you’ll live in a forest full of poison. \n\n Avoid looking for problems where there are none – because you will find what you seek. \n\n The grass is always (and never) greener when you fail to water your own, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I had fun with this one. My creativity is way better here than it is in Miami. I think I’d like it here better, for sure. After all, the constant reggaeton in Miami gets annoying. And everythings so congested! Hmmm. \n\n P.P.S. ^ that is sarcasm to illustrate my point if you’re slow and didn’t catch it. \n\n ​",

I certainly couldn’t.\r\n\r\nAnd then this Asian girl walked out of Starbucks really quickly\r\nand really… hard.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure how else to explain her strut.\r\n\r\nIt was like she was exerting all of her force into each step and\r\nswaying aggressively from side to side.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the way you’d see the nerdy, overly excited, yet timid\r\ngirls walk in school.\r\n\r\nI didn’t even mention the homeless man to my left, who’s been\r\nmurmuring random sentences for the last few minutes, but let’s\r\nmove on.\r\n\r\nOften times when I don’t have an immediate idea to write about,\r\nI’ll start the email the way I did above.\r\n\r\nJust a bunch of random little observations of my surroundings.\r\n\r\nMaybe that’s a lesson.\r\n\r\nI feel much more present now than I did a few minutes ago.\r\n\r\nI also think it helps put me in a different state where I no\r\nlonger approach this blank page with the thought of “I need to\r\nthink of something to write about.”\r\n\r\nBut rather, I just start writing, and whatever comes to mind goes\r\non the page.\r\n\r\nLet’s extrapolate these two things to life:\r\n\r\nYou know how all guided meditations start with presence?\r\n\r\n“Focus on your breathing, feel the seat beneath you, place your\r\nattention on your chest, etc.”\r\n\r\nIt serves as a reminder that you are here — where unless you’re\r\nin some immediate danger or physical pain, nothing is wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd when you’re fully present this way, that’s when you’re at\r\nyour best.\r\n\r\nOk, quick detour, the homeless guy to my left is starting to get\r\ninto an aggressive argument with someone in his head and growing\r\nincreasingly loud.\r\n\r\nIf he mistakes me for the person in his head, I’m ready to throw\r\nhands with this guy.\r\n\r\nHe just got up and scurried away.\r\n\r\nIt’s interesting because I’ve seen this guy in particular a lot\r\nand sometimes he’s been semi-normal.\r\n\r\nI heard him having a conversation about the Ohio State and\r\nMichigan football rivalry, and it sounded perfectly sane.\r\n\r\nI guess that’s schizophrenia for ya.\r\n\r\nI’m sidetracked now and forget what I was gonna say before that\r\ndetour. Ironic for an email about presence.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the last thing I’ll share with ya...\r\n\r\nMy agency has consistently been over $100k a month for a few\r\nmonths now while working with just 6-9 clients at a time.\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n\r\n* Rev shares are how you make real money with an agency\r\n* Getting clients through inbound and referrals is far superior\r\nto cold outreach.\r\n* Do not be afraid to sacrifice some margin and delegate — this\r\nhas been a big one for me as I started to feel burnt out with\r\nclient work.\r\n* Learning direct response copy is the first fundamental skill\r\nyou need. Over time you can add complementary skills that make\r\nyou more valuable to businesses.\r\n\r\nAlrighty, that’s all for today.\r\n\r\nIf you have any specific questions - whether it’s about business\r\nor anything else I ramble about here, reply and lmk\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh2kwp68c2hx2x0m66\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh2kwp68c2hx2x0m66\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh2kwp68c2hx2x0m66/m2h7h5h8ox7gonfm/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

I certainly couldn’t. \n\n And then this Asian girl walked out of Starbucks really quickly and really… hard. \n\n I’m not sure how else to explain her strut. \n\n It was like she was exerting all of her force into each step and swaying aggressively from side to side. \n\n Similar to the way you’d see the nerdy, overly excited, yet timid girls walk in school. \n\n I didn’t even mention the homeless man to my left, who’s been murmuring random sentences for the last few minutes, but let’s move on. \n\n Often times when I don’t have an immediate idea to write about, I’ll start the email the way I did above. \n\n Just a bunch of random little observations of my surroundings. \n\n Maybe that’s a lesson. \n\n I feel much more present now than I did a few minutes ago. \n\n I also think it helps put me in a different state where I no longer approach this blank page with the thought of “I need to think of something to write about.” \n\n But rather, I just start writing, and whatever comes to mind goes on the page. \n\n Let’s extrapolate these two things to life: \n\n You know how all guided meditations start with presence? \n\n “Focus on your breathing, feel the seat beneath you, place your attention on your chest, etc.” \n\n It serves as a reminder that you are here — where unless you’re in some immediate danger or physical pain, nothing is wrong. \n\n And when you’re fully present this way, that’s when you’re at your best. \n\n Ok, quick detour, the homeless guy to my left is starting to get into an aggressive argument with someone in his head and growing increasingly loud. \n\n If he mistakes me for the person in his head, I’m ready to throw hands with this guy. \n\n He just got up and scurried away. \n\n It’s interesting because I’ve seen this guy in particular a lot and sometimes he’s been semi-normal. \n\n I heard him having a conversation about the Ohio State and Michigan football rivalry, and it sounded perfectly sane. \n\n I guess that’s schizophrenia for ya. \n\n I’m sidetracked now and forget what I was gonna say before that detour. Ironic for an email about presence. \n\n Anyway, the last thing I’ll share with ya... \n\n My agency has consistently been over $100k a month for a few months now while working with just 6-9 clients at a time. \n\n A few notes: \n\n Rev shares are how you make real money with an agency Getting clients through inbound and referrals is far superior to cold outreach. Do not be afraid to sacrifice some margin and delegate — this has been a big one for me as I started to feel burnt out with client work. Learning direct response copy is the first fundamental skill you need. Over time you can add complementary skills that make you more valuable to businesses. Alrighty, that’s all for today. \n\n If you have any specific questions - whether it’s about business or anything else I ramble about here, reply and lmk <3 \n\n Ben \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "Let’s talk about business.\r\n\r\nIf you have zero clue what I do and how it works, here’s a brief\r\nTLDR:\r\n\r\nI run a marketing agency where I work with many of the big\r\npersonal brands that you see online with hundreds of thousands of\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nOver the last few months, we’ve consistently been over $100k per\r\nmonth with minimal expenses.\r\n\r\nI have a team of 3 people, and we work with around 7-10 clients\r\nat a time.\r\n\r\nThe majority of clients we work with are making anywhere from\r\n$100k- $600k per month selling info-products and coaching\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\nMost of the revenue we bring in as an agency comes from our\r\n10-20% performance fees on the revenue we generate.\r\n\r\nOur bread and butter as an agency are webinars and new product\r\nlaunches.\r\n\r\nWe provide full-stack services to our clients, meaning we build\r\ntheir funnels, script VSLs, script and build slides for webinars,\r\nrun email marketing, and provide a few other services, including\r\ngeneral consulting.\r\n\r\nAll of our clients come to us through referrals and my Twitter\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nMake sense so far?\r\n\r\nHere’s how I ended up here:\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I started a different agency working with\r\nbasketball trainers.\r\n\r\nI was able to work with many of the trainers you may see on\r\nsocial media that had big audiences, and in that process, I got\r\nreally good at one thing:\r\n\r\nGetting people to take action through the written word, otherwise\r\nknown as copywriting.\r\n\r\nI also accumulated a handful of other skills that I use with the\r\nclients we work with, including funnel building, backend system\r\nsetup, and a deep understanding of info-product businesses as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nI don’t know how this all may relate to you, but perhaps you’re\r\nan agency owner or freelancer who wants to make more money with\r\nfewer clients.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the biggest things I’ve learned in going from\r\n$25k/mo - $100k/mo+ over the past year:\r\n\r\n* The real money is in revenue shares. To be able to get rev\r\nshares where clients pay you $20k+ without batting an eye, you\r\nmust become irreplaceable in their business. This is where the\r\nmultitude of services we offer (and do better than 99% of other\r\nagencies) comes in handy.\r\n* You need a team, but hiring doesn’t have to be difficult. I’m a\r\nhorrible operator, and I didn’t want to have to babysit new team\r\nmembers I brought on. So, my team consists of 2 of my closest who\r\nwere already very skilled in the work we do. And although I\r\nsacrifice some margin, it saves me so much time and headache that\r\nI would have if I tried to do everything on my own.\r\n* Client results & personal brand is the best form of outreach.\r\nTwo months ago, I closed a new client who found me through\r\nTwitter and knew some of the people we work with. He’s paid us\r\nover $50k, mostly from our performance fees. I have opportunities\r\nlike this come up frequently because of the two assets I\r\nmentioned above (client results & personal brand).\r\n* Do not be afraid to cut ties with clients when things are not\r\ngoing the way you need them to. I am selective with who I bring\r\non, and I’ve learned that short-term cash is never worth the\r\nheadache when I see red flags. I turn away most of the prospects\r\nthat book calls with me if they don’t fit the criteria that I\r\nknow we need to succeed.\r\n\r\nIf you’re working in a similar type of business, I hope this\r\nhelps.

    "body": "I’ve been going to a different coffee shop recently.\r\n\r\nThis one’s a bit more liberal, and I think they pump estrogen\r\ninto the air. All the employees are wearing reindeer ears and the\r\nmale barista attempts to hold eye contact with me for a few\r\nmilliseconds too long.\r\n\r\nI evade and tell him to make me an $8 iced latte with vanilla.\r\n\r\nBefore I got here, I was scouring my apartment. I tore up my\r\noffice, dug under the couch, swept through the kitchen, and even\r\nlooked in my bathroom although I knew there was little chance I’d\r\nfind what I was looking for in there.\r\n\r\nIt’s not that I even wanted to find the item that bad, it’s that\r\nI knew it was there somewhere which was driving me crazy.\r\n\r\nBut for now, I’m listening to Christmas music at this cafe\r\nbecause I had no luck finding my airpods.\r\n\r\nI rarely wear headphones. But when I do, it’s because I’m in a\r\nnoisy area and I want to write. Listening to my own music helps\r\nme feel like I’m in my own world where I can ignore the\r\ndorky-looking man at the counter to my right wearing a fanny pack\r\naround his shoulder.\r\n\r\nI literally remember putting them on my counter yesterday.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone broke into my apartment, ignored the expensive\r\nwatches, my car keys, and any other more valuable items they\r\ncould’ve taken, and decided to run away with my disgustingly\r\nearwax-stained airpods. Hahaha.\r\n\r\nI had something I wanted to write to you about, but I’ve gotten\r\nso sidetracked that I completely forget it now. I guess it’s just\r\nthat kind of morning.\r\n\r\nSomething that’s been on my mind however is career paths.\r\n\r\nI don’t understand how people can stay in one role in the same\r\nfield for more than a few years.\r\n\r\nEspecially as entrepreneurs. Maybe I’m just immature, but\r\nthinking about doing the same exact thing I’m doing now for the\r\nnext 3 years makes me want to chew glass.\r\n\r\nSure you can always make the argument that “feelings don’t\r\nmatter. Do it anyway” blah blah.\r\n\r\nAnd I know there will always be some things I don’t want to do in\r\nany business I run. But to me it just makes sense to upgrade or\r\nswitch business models every few years (if that’s what feels\r\nright).\r\n\r\nI get bored doing the same thing every day after a while.\r\n\r\nAgain, you can make a sound argument that it doesn’t matter how\r\nyou feel and that you should power through the things you don’t\r\nwant to do.\r\n\r\nBut you can also make the counterargument that if you can find\r\nexcitement in your work, you’ll be much more effective than when\r\nyou’re dreading it.

    "body": "I’ve been going to a different coffee shop recently. \n\n This one’s a bit more liberal, and I think they pump estrogen into the air. All the employees are wearing reindeer ears and the male barista attempts to hold eye contact with me for a few milliseconds too long. \n\n I evade and tell him to make me an $8 iced latte with vanilla. \n\n Before I got here, I was scouring my apartment. I tore up my office, dug under the couch, swept through the kitchen, and even looked in my bathroom although I knew there was little chance I’d find what I was looking for in there. \n\n It’s not that I even wanted to find the item that bad, it’s that I knew it was there somewhere which was driving me crazy. \n\n But for now, I’m listening to Christmas music at this cafe because I had no luck finding my airpods. \n\n I rarely wear headphones. But when I do, it’s because I’m in a noisy area and I want to write. Listening to my own music helps me feel like I’m in my own world where I can ignore the dorky-looking man at the counter to my right wearing a fanny pack around his shoulder. \n\n I literally remember putting them on my counter yesterday. \n\n Maybe someone broke into my apartment, ignored the expensive watches, my car keys, and any other more valuable items they could’ve taken, and decided to run away with my disgustingly earwax-stained airpods. Hahaha. \n\n I had something I wanted to write to you about, but I’ve gotten so sidetracked that I completely forget it now. I guess it’s just that kind of morning. \n\n Something that’s been on my mind however is career paths. \n\n I don’t understand how people can stay in one role in the same field for more than a few years. \n\n Especially as entrepreneurs. Maybe I’m just immature, but thinking about doing the same exact thing I’m doing now for the next 3 years makes me want to chew glass. \n\n Sure you can always make the argument that “feelings don’t matter. Do it anyway” blah blah. \n\n And I know there will always be some things I don’t want to do in any business I run. But to me it just makes sense to upgrade or switch business models every few years (if that’s what feels right). \n\n I get bored doing the same thing every day after a while. \n\n Again, you can make a sound argument that it doesn’t matter how you feel and that you should power through the things you don’t want to do. \n\n But you can also make the counterargument that if you can find excitement in your work, you’ll be much more effective than when you’re dreading it. Even if that means your business model has to change or evolve every so often. \n\n Last point on this and then I gotta run: I’m not saying you should constantly be jumping from one completely different business to another. \n\n You likely have innate skills that can be applied in a variety of different ways, and sometimes being open to the application of your skill set in a similar or parallel field may make sense. \n\n You with me here? \n\n I could be completely wrong, but thanks for reading anyway. Let me know if you liked this one. \n\n Happy Christmas and Merry Hanukkah. \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Watch my recent YouTube video Or... Watch my recent Podcast ​\n\n ​",

    "timestamp": "1703698487000",
    "body": "I’ve been in the online marketing space for about three years\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThroughout this time, I’ve met a lot of people who were trying to\r\n“make it” as entrepreneurs. Some completely failed, some\r\nstagnated, and others have been on par with the same level of\r\nsuccess I’ve seen or have found financial success quicker than\r\nme.\r\n\r\nObviously, there are unicorns, but for the most part,\r\nintelligence doesn’t seem to play a huge role as long a baseline\r\nlevel of competence is established.\r\n\r\nIt’s similar to being a professional athlete – at the highest\r\nlevels, everyone is a “freak” athlete. It’s the minimum standard,\r\nand generally, the intangibles are what separates the good from\r\nthe great.\r\n\r\nHere are a few of the less tangible traits I see in my more\r\nsuccessful friends (which those who stagnate or fail seem to\r\nlack):\r\n\r\n1. Ingenuity & craftiness: In the world of entrepreneurship,\r\nrules are meant to be broken, loopholes are meant to be found,\r\nand the lines between what works and what doesn’t are blurred.\r\n\r\nThere’s a proclaimed “right way” to find success, and then\r\nthere's the way that actually works for you.\r\n\r\nCreativity and persistence will (sometimes) take you much further\r\nthan blindly following a “proven system” that other people tell\r\nyou to.\r\n\r\n2. Discipline & the ability to create order in chaos: Freedom\r\ncauses most people to lose their minds. When you’re accustomed to\r\nbeing told what to do, what to think, and where to be, having to\r\ntell yourself those things is a big adjustment.\r\n\r\nBuild a system for yourself that works for you. Again, it doesn’t\r\nhave to be what other people are doing as long as it puts you in\r\nan environment and mental space that allows you to do what you\r\nneed to do.\r\n\r\n3. Comfortable with the unknown: Eventually, you come to the\r\nrealization that no matter how much you plan, no matter how hard\r\nyou try, and no matter how badly you want something to happen,\r\nyou are not in complete control of the outcome.\r\n\r\nCertainty makes us feel safe. And if you’re too attached to that\r\nfeeling of safety, go get a desk job and a 401k. Or prepare to\r\nalways have a voice in the back of your head that thinks\r\neverything is gonna crumble at any given moment.\r\n\r\nBonus trait 4 - The gut feeling paradox: There’s a balance\r\nbetween listening to signs from the universe that tell you that\r\nyou need to make a change versus jumping from one shiny object to\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when things don’t feel right, it’s a sign that you\r\nneed to make a change.\r\n\r\nOther times, when things don’t feel right, it’s a sign that\r\nyou’re on the cusp of something great if you can power through\r\nthat feeling.\r\n\r\nThis is a constant game. I don’t have any advice on how to\r\nnavigate it because truthfully, I don’t know if anyone does.\r\n\r\nI guess that brings us back to trait #3, huh?\r\n\r\nAlrighty, hope you liked this one. Keep pushing these next few\r\ndays and build momentum going into 2024.\r\n\r\nHappy hump day, let me know if you read this whole thing\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "I’ve been in the online marketing space for about three years now. \n\n Throughout this time, I’ve met a lot of people who were trying to “make it” as entrepreneurs. Some completely failed, some stagnated, and others have been on par with the same level of success I’ve seen or have found financial success quicker than me. \n\n Obviously, there are unicorns, but for the most part, intelligence doesn’t seem to play a huge role as long a baseline level of competence is established. \n\n It’s similar to being a professional athlete – at the highest levels, everyone is a “freak” athlete. It’s the minimum standard, and generally, the intangibles are what separates the good from the great. \n\n Here are a few of the less tangible traits I see in my more successful friends (which those who stagnate or fail seem to lack): \n\n 1. Ingenuity & craftiness: In the world of entrepreneurship, rules are meant to be broken, loopholes are meant to be found, and the lines between what works and what doesn’t are blurred. \n\n There’s a proclaimed “right way” to find success, and then there's the way that actually works for you. \n\n Creativity and persistence will (sometimes) take you much further than blindly following a “proven system” that other people tell you to. \n\n 2. Discipline & the ability to create order in chaos: Freedom causes most people to lose their minds. When you’re accustomed to being told what to do, what to think, and where to be, having to tell yourself those things is a big adjustment. \n\n Build a system for yourself that works for you. Again, it doesn’t have to be what other people are doing as long as it puts you in an environment and mental space that allows you to do what you need to do. \n\n 3. Comfortable with the unknown: Eventually, you come to the realization that no matter how much you plan, no matter how hard you try, and no matter how badly you want something to happen, you are not in complete control of the outcome. \n\n Certainty makes us feel safe. And if you’re too attached to that feeling of safety, go get a desk job and a 401k. Or prepare to always have a voice in the back of your head that thinks everything is gonna crumble at any given moment. \n\n Bonus trait 4 - The gut feeling paradox: There’s a balance between listening to signs from the universe that tell you that you need to make a change versus jumping from one shiny object to the next. \n\n Sometimes, when things don’t feel right, it’s a sign that you need to make a change. \n\n Other times, when things don’t feel right, it’s a sign that you’re on the cusp of something great if you can power through that feeling. \n\n This is a constant game. I don’t have any advice on how to navigate it because truthfully, I don’t know if anyone does. \n\n I guess that brings us back to trait #3, huh? \n\n Alrighty, hope you liked this one. Keep pushing these next few days and build momentum going into 2024. \n\n Happy hump day, let me know if you read this whole thing <3 \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. If you still haven’t watched my recent YouTube video, go here plz. ​ \n\n ​",

This one’s simple, so I won’t spend too much time here. \n\n - Clear idea client avatar \n\n We’ve become quite strict on the type of business for which we can provide the best work. \n\n If a prospect comes to us wanting a funnel, webinar, VSL, or email list management, yet they have little traffic and a minimal email list, we do not pitch them. \n\n We usually refer them to a friend who can help them with their organic content or simply give them pointers on how to build their audience. \n\n They sometimes end up coming back months later after they’ve taken the steps we gave them on the call. \n\n - Personal brand & network \n\n If you go to my Twitter or TikTok, there is proof that I am a real human doing real things. It’s also clear that I’m not another self-proclaimed “expert agency owner” who regurgitates the same three talking points. \n\n This makes it so people develop a bit of a relationship with me and my idealogy before we ever get on the phone. \n\n I’m telling you all this in order to show you that many things you may think you need to find success are often a facade. \n\n Whether you run an agency or a completely different type of business, your success often boils down to a few key factors. \n\n Once you understand what those factors are, double down on them rather than wasting time trying to find the next magic pill that will carry you to the promised land. \n\n Repeat successful actions, and success becomes inevitable. \n\n Let me know if you liked this one, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I’m making another YouTube video this week. Reply and let me know if there’s anything you’d like me to talk about in my next video, and click here to watch my most recent video. ​ \n\n ​",

Or coffee\r\nshops? Merging onto a highway?\r\n\r\nIt’s like their systems get overloaded, and they revert to monkey\r\nbrains, where they just start making sounds and looking for\r\nbananas.\r\n\r\nAnyway, let’s talk about more important things.\r\n\r\nImagine you’re building yourself a car.\r\n\r\nYou get all the parts you need and spend countless hours\r\nconfiguring your vehicle.\r\n\r\nFinally, you’re ready to hit the road.\r\n\r\nYou hop in and start driving.\r\n\r\nAt first, it’s great. You’re excited to finally enjoy the fruits\r\nof your labor.\r\n\r\nBut after a few hundred miles, the engine starts making a strange\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nYou pull over and pop the hood.\r\n\r\nIt’s a minor problem, and you know exactly what you need to do to\r\nfix it.\r\n\r\nYou close the hood and tell yourself you’ll fix it later.\r\n\r\nAs you continue driving, you see another car and are immediately\r\nenamored.\r\n\r\n“That’s the kind of car I want,” you think to yourself.\r\n\r\nWhen you get home, you order parts and set out to build it.\r\n\r\nOver the next few months, you start neglecting car #1, and the\r\nminor problem with the engine has turned into a much bigger\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nInstead of fixing it, you spend all your time building a new car.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, once your “perfect” car is ready, you hit the road.\r\nAnd the cycle continues. You see a new car you like better,\r\nneglect your own, and start all over.\r\n\r\nSee where I’m going with this?\r\n\r\nThis is how many of us treat our businesses, relationships, and a\r\nvariety of other endeavors.\r\n\r\nWe spend so much time laying the foundation for what could be\r\nsomething special.\r\n\r\nBut once the novelty wears off and we realize the constant\r\nmaintenance that’s necessary for continuous progression, we start\r\nlooking for the \"new thing.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of putting our feet on the gas and maximizing what’s in\r\nfront of us, we let what we’ve built deteriorate so that we can\r\nhave an excuse to start all over.\r\n\r\nIt’s a familiar comfort. It allows for the illusion of\r\nproductivity.

    "body": "Sorry for the week-long hiatus, but I’m back. \n\n It’s been frigid the last few days in Miami, like mid 50’s- low 60’s cold. \n\n I’m going to New York tomorrow, and I don’t imagine it’ll be any warmer there. \n\n Such a tough life! \n\n I can’t remember if I’ve told you about one of my friends who works in my building. \n\n He’s a Hispanic dude in his early 40’s but looks much younger. \n\n We see each other nearly daily, and he talks to me in Spanish as I nod and smile in confusion. \n\n I don’t know his name so I call him Papi. I genuinely think he’s the happiest person I know. \n\n Papi always has a smile on his face and just radiates energy that lets you know he’s grateful to be alive. \n\n Yesterday in the elevator I told him I just went to the gym (fui al gimnasio) and was about to get work done (voy a trabajo). \n\n In English he said, “Life is working.” \n\n Papi probably knows a total of 100 words in the English dictionary, but those three together can be quite powerful. \n\n I recently realized that I’d developed a bad habit. \n\n No matter how great things are, I’m constantly pondering every detail of my life – even the things I already understand and have no reason to be stressing about. \n\n “How am I gonna make more money?” \n\n “How is this relationship gonna work out?” \n\n “Why don’t I feel the way I anticipated when I envisioned the lifestyle I’m living now?” \n\n “What do I need to change?” \n\n All I’m doing as I think about these things is reinforcing the idea that there is some future Utopia that I don’t have access to right now. \n\n No bueno. \n\n Most of us need to think less and do more. \n\n You can analyze and reflect once you reach the top of the mountain. \n\n But until then, \n\n Feet on gas. \n\n Head down. \n\n Quiet mind. \n\n Life is working. \n\n Thanks for reading - glad to be back. \n\n Talk soon, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

Branching out\r\n\r\nI went out of my way to make new friends and build a bigger\r\nnetwork in Miami.\r\n\r\nOnce I met one or two well-connected people, it created a\r\nsnowball effect in my social life.\r\n\r\nOutside of just my network, I started to “branch out” by taking\r\nup new hobbies, like boxing and tennis.\r\n\r\nFinding new interests and hobbies like this helped me reinvent my\r\nperception of myself.\r\n\r\nThis helped reshape my identity and made me feel like I had more\r\nexciting things going on in my life.\r\n\r\n3. Social media\r\n\r\nIf you go look at my Instagram toward the end of July, you can\r\nsee a shift occur.\r\n\r\nEven my facial expression and demeanor appear more confident in\r\nmore recent photos.\r\n\r\nI know it may sound superficial, but putting effort into making a\r\nbetter-looking Instagram and posting consistently on TikTok has\r\nopened so many doors and brought me a world of connections.\r\n\r\nThese three things helped me enter a version of myself that I\r\ncouldn’t access previously.\r\n\r\nMy lifestyle is exactly the way I envisioned it when I pictured\r\nliving in Miami.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is just a “side quest” to the main mission (getting\r\ndisgustingly rich), it’s brought me a lot of clarity and taught\r\nme lessons that I couldn’t have learned at my desk.\r\n\r\nCheers to life-maxxing.\r\n\r\nCall your ex today,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "Yesterday, I saw a clip of Johnny Manziel talking about how\r\ndepressed he was during his first couple of years playing in the\r\nNFL.\r\n\r\nHe said Lebron, who was his childhood hero, would call him a few\r\ntimes a week to hang out, and he’d decline because he didn’t want\r\nto leave the house.\r\n\r\nLooking at this from the outside in, here’s what I gather:\r\n\r\nOnce you begin to get the things you want, you gradually\r\ninternalize that they won’t change anything.\r\n\r\nBy “things you want,” I don't just mean material items or\r\nlifestyle, but also your outward perception.\r\n\r\nYou can get all the praise, respect, and validation.\r\n\r\nYou can be the guy other dudes envy and girls want to be with.\r\n\r\nThis comes with a lot of pressure, which can break you if your\r\nself-image isn’t rock solid.\r\n\r\nThe expectations of others start to weigh on you, and your\r\nstandards rise to a level that takes a lot to maintain.\r\n\r\nIf you feel undeserving, you manifest that idea into reality.\r\n\r\nYour motivation dwindles, you lack discipline, and you start to\r\nlet your problems add up.\r\n\r\n“You can’t outperform your self-image.”\r\n\r\nThe weight of the contrast between how others perceive you versus\r\nhow you perceive yourself causes you to crumble.\r\n\r\nThat make sense?\r\n\r\nAnyway, a guy in front of me at this coffee shop is reading the\r\nbook “7 Habits Of Highly Effective People.”\r\n\r\nHe’s mouthing the words as he reads, which I find interesting.\r\n\r\nWhen I walked in to order my coffee, the barista told me she\r\nliked my hoodie and replied, “Ben 10” when I told her my name was\r\nBen.\r\n\r\nI found that endearing, so I gave her the Van Cleef bracelet off\r\nmy wrist.\r\n\r\nOne time, I sat next to Johnny Manziel at dinner (I think I told\r\nyou about that in an email months ago).\r\n\r\nNot long after, he DM’d the girl I was with that night.\r\n\r\nShooters shoot, I guess.\r\n\r\nLast thing – Yesterday, I was journaling and asked myself, “What\r\nwould make your life better than it is right now?”\r\n\r\nIt was easy to come up with an answer to that question, and I\r\nfound it interesting that my answer had little to do with more\r\nmoney or anything flashy.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to ask yourself the same thing when you have 20\r\nmin today.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, and hope you enjoyed,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hd999p7crh5x5e699\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hd999p7crh5x5e699\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hd999p7crh5x5e699/8ghqhohlqree22bk/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "* { word-break: break-word; }\r\n\r\nHappy Friday bo,\r\n\r\nI wrote this one yesterday and forgot to send it once I got to my\r\nhotel, so I am sending it now.\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI’m on a flight to LA right now.\r\n\r\nI land in about 30 minutes and have spent the last 4 hours\r\nfinding clever ways to procrastinate writing this email.\r\n\r\nIt started with the usual scroll through social media, but that\r\ncan only last so long.\r\n\r\nSo I got creative. I took a personality quiz, changed my return\r\nflight, got ahead on some work, and did enough research on LA\r\nrestaurants that I could write one of those gay “Top 10 MUST TRY\r\nspots in LA” blog posts.\r\n\r\nJust so you know, I’m in seat 1A.

I took a personality quiz, changed my return flight, got ahead on some work, and did enough research on LA restaurants that I could write one of those gay “Top 10 MUST TRY spots in LA” blog posts. \n\n Just so you know, I’m in seat 1A. There’s no reason for me to tell you this, but I figured I’d tell you anyway. \n\n Let’s talk about money and identity. \n\n When I first started making some money a few years ago, my mental well-being became entirely reliant on my monthly income. \n\n When I’d hit a new all-time high, I’d be over the moon. \n\n I was more confident, I spoke with conviction, and I generally felt and acted much more positively. \n\n Conversely, when my monthly income stagnated or regressed, I lost all confidence and was in a constant state of panic. \n\n When I’d talk to people, I wasn’t really there. I was physically there, but my mind would drift, drowning out the person who was talking with my own thoughts. \n\n These times were interesting. \n\n This fight-or-flight mode wasn’t pleasant, but I think it helped me progress quicker. \n\n All I thought about was business. \n\n Recently, it’s been the opposite. I honestly don’t know if it’s been a good or bad month for the agency numbers-wise. \n\n We did help a client make $400k in 4 days recently which was pretty cool. \n\n He paid us our commission in crypto, so I threw all that money into a meme coin. \n\n Back to the main point - I’ve been the opposite of “locked in” recently. \n\n Locked out? \n\n Opened in? \n\n Not sure of the correct term. \n\n Everyone loves to act like they’re always working so hard. \n\n This may cause you to feel like you constantly need to be at war, as it did for me. \n\n It also meant my self-image was tied to my income. \n\n While I think that can be a good thing to an extent, it’s a hamster wheel that no amount of money can get you off of. \n\n Sure, if you’re not growing, you’re dying — but growth can come in many forms. \n\n It doesn’t always mean you’re doubling your monthly income or spending 12 hours a day at your desk. \n\n Maybe it means you’re traveling more, building deeper relationships, beating your friend Jimmy in 2K, etc. \n\n Simply side questing. \n\n And know there will be a time when you need to lock back in. \n\n You can’t just coast forever — but sometimes, momentary coasting can help you return to work with an added excitement. \n\n Or at least that’s what I’m telling myself. \n\n I'm about to land and gotta wrap this up, but there is one last thing I want to add… \n\n *Everything I just said does not apply to you if you don’t have enough money to fulfill the immediate image that pops into your head when you think about having money. \n\n For me, that image is the exact life I’m living now. \n\n I imagine for me to find the motivation to push beyond where I’m at now, that vision must evolve. \n\n Ok, I just landed.

    "body": "A large corner of the internet is very angry at me right now because of this tweet. ​\n\n They’re calling me a scammer posting rage bait to sell my course. \n\n If you’ve been around for a while, you know I don’t have one – although I probably should. \n\n This reaction has been surprising to me as I didn’t think much of the post when I sent it. \n\n The thought was formed while I was in a crowded elevator going up to my apartment. \n\n There was a guy who looked a few years older than me with airpods in and a bag of Chipotle in hand. \n\n He was visibly disgruntled, carrying a black work bag. \n\n When we stopped to let others off on the way up, he spammed the “close door” button, almost shutting it on a few people who were too slow for his liking. \n\n Considering it was a Friday around 5 pm, I imagined he’d just gotten off work after a long, boring week and was eager to get home and devour his burrito on the couch. \n\n I could be completely wrong in my assessment, but I then started thinking about what my life would’ve looked like had I continued on the college, 9-5 route. \n\n And that tweet is what I came up with. \n\n I didn’t mean to attack this life path but rather paint a vivid picture of what I wanted to avoid – who knows if it would’ve actually been my reality. \n\n My Twitter is unusable right now, as every time I refresh, I have dozens of new notifications from wagies who felt attacked by my words. \n\n If anything, they’re proving my point to be true; if they didn’t partially identify with the person I described, they wouldn’t be offended, right? \n\n To me, it looks like they’re trying to defend the lie they’ve sold themselves that they’re happy with an average existence. \n\n I guess every hive needs worker bees. \n\n Anyway, I’ll stop being mean and move on to a completely unrelated topic. \n\n Something that’s been on my mind recently is the difference between short “flings” and hookups compared to longer-term relationships. \n\n Any guy who’s casually dated many girls knows at some point, the game gets a bit too easy. \n\n Although it’s fun, it’s kind of like an iceberg. \n\n You show someone just enough of your personality for them to start to romanticize you. \n\n By nature, you end up saying similar lines, sharing the same stories, and cultivating a particular image of yourself. \n\n You can do this endlessly – revealing a glimpse of your character to new people over and over. \n\n Once you reach the stage where the entire tip of the iceberg has been revealed (pause, no homo), you bounce to the next situationship to do it all over again. \n\n You never give anyone the chance to get to know you past the image you aim to portray. \n\n And there’s nothing wrong with that. Maybe it’s just a phase of life that you’re in, or you’re especially selective about who you spend an extended period of time with. \n\n But if and when you move past the casual fling stage, you realize there’s no longer a place to hide. \n\n Your flaws and insecurities are reflected back to you when you let someone get to know the real you, and that process reveals your self-image. \n\n Fake confidence only lasts for so long, and if there are areas in your identity that you’re not comfortable with, you’ll be forced to make amends with them. \n\n I hope this makes sense to you. I’d go a bit more in-depth, but I just realized that I have hundreds of new subscribers here. \n\n Some of whom are probably ops that were angry at my tweet and will do anything they can to take what I say in this email out of context. \n\n So I’ll let them weed themselves out, and then we’ll continue our regularly scheduled programming. \n\n Anyway, It’s date night with sweet pea tonight! \n\n Can’t wait to try the restaurant and watch our favorite show on the couch!!!! \n\n Hah. \n\n Happy early Easter, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. If you’re new here, watch this to learn more about me and how I built a 7-figure copywriting business. ​\n\n P.P.S. Check out my previous emails here. ​\n\n ​",

    "body": "I’m 37 minutes into an hour-long Tai Lopez rant on YouTube and\r\njust clicked pause to write this.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I wrote a tweet about shifting your identity and\r\nwanted to expand on it.\r\n\r\nIt’s long, so it’ll take up the majority of this email, but I\r\ngenuinely think this is one of the keys to making continuous\r\nprogress in any realm of life.\r\n\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\nThe speed at which you progress is dependent on your ability and\r\nwillingness to shift into a new identity when you complete the\r\nvision you were formerly working toward.\r\n\r\nWhen you actualize financial/lifestyle goals, it’s like you’re\r\nbeating a level in a video game. the next level is an entirely\r\ndifferent game, and you’re starting at zero with new obstacles\r\nthat you’re unfamiliar with.\r\n\r\nSometimes, you may fail or refuse to move to the next level\r\nbecause you’re comfortable with the current level you’re\r\noperating at and the problems associated with it.\r\n\r\nThis is where you get trapped.\r\n\r\nStay in one identity for too long, and your lack of progression\r\nstarts to eat away at you.\r\n\r\nSo, you begin to sabotage your current reality because you want\r\nto feel like you’re moving forward.\r\n\r\nThe only way to do that while avoiding a complete shift in your\r\nidentity is to first move backward and then go back up the ladder\r\nyou already climbed.\r\n\r\nSo you’re now spending your time beating the same level of a\r\nvideo game only to click the reset button and start over.\r\n\r\nThis is the trap of stagnation, where you give yourself the\r\nillusion of progress.”\r\n\r\nI’ve found that whenever I feel stuck, it’s because I’m simply\r\nrefusing to step into a new identity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you’ve heard the saying, “The vehicle that gets you to\r\npoint A isn’t the vehicle that gets you to point B.”\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the person you are right now has a ceiling.\r\n\r\nYou can reach a certain level financially, emotionally, and\r\nspiritually.\r\n\r\nOnce you reach the peak of that level, you have the choice to\r\ncontinue progressing or stay where you are.\r\n\r\nAnd change is hard.\r\n\r\nThis is especially true when that change requires you to discard\r\nyour previous beliefs about yourself and replace them with\r\nbeliefs that will suit you in the new arena you are stepping\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nYou can spend eons avoiding this and fool yourself into believing\r\nyou’re making progress when you’re actually sputtering.\r\n\r\nBut this will only create an internal hell.\r\n\r\nYou know you’re capable of more, and you’re resisting.\r\n\r\nThe solution here can be summed up into three words:\r\n\r\nDecide, commit, act.\r\n\r\nDevise a plan to reach your next level, paint a vivid picture of\r\nhow this new version of you operates, and execute that plan.\r\n\r\nIt’s the work you’re avoiding, the habits you’re refusing to\r\ndevelop, and the beliefs that hurt to change.\r\n\r\nIt’ll be painful, but so will the feeling of staying the same.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the only way through.\r\n\r\nTalk tomorrow,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​Read my previous emails here.

    "body": "I’m 37 minutes into an hour-long Tai Lopez rant on YouTube and just clicked pause to write this. \n\n Yesterday, I wrote a tweet about shifting your identity and wanted to expand on it. \n\n It’s long, so it’ll take up the majority of this email, but I genuinely think this is one of the keys to making continuous progress in any realm of life. \n\n Here it is: \n\n The speed at which you progress is dependent on your ability and willingness to shift into a new identity when you complete the vision you were formerly working toward. \n\n When you actualize financial/lifestyle goals, it’s like you’re beating a level in a video game. the next level is an entirely different game, and you’re starting at zero with new obstacles that you’re unfamiliar with. \n\n Sometimes, you may fail or refuse to move to the next level because you’re comfortable with the current level you’re operating at and the problems associated with it. \n\n This is where you get trapped. \n\n Stay in one identity for too long, and your lack of progression starts to eat away at you. \n\n So, you begin to sabotage your current reality because you want to feel like you’re moving forward. \n\n The only way to do that while avoiding a complete shift in your identity is to first move backward and then go back up the ladder you already climbed. \n\n So you’re now spending your time beating the same level of a video game only to click the reset button and start over. \n\n This is the trap of stagnation, where you give yourself the illusion of progress.” \n\n I’ve found that whenever I feel stuck, it’s because I’m simply refusing to step into a new identity. \n\n Perhaps you’ve heard the saying, “The vehicle that gets you to point A isn’t the vehicle that gets you to point B.” \n\n Similarly, the person you are right now has a ceiling. \n\n You can reach a certain level financially, emotionally, and spiritually. \n\n Once you reach the peak of that level, you have the choice to continue progressing or stay where you are. \n\n And change is hard. \n\n This is especially true when that change requires you to discard your previous beliefs about yourself and replace them with beliefs that will suit you in the new arena you are stepping into. \n\n You can spend eons avoiding this and fool yourself into believing you’re making progress when you’re actually sputtering. \n\n But this will only create an internal hell. \n\n You know you’re capable of more, and you’re resisting. \n\n The solution here can be summed up into three words: \n\n Decide, commit, act. \n\n Devise a plan to reach your next level, paint a vivid picture of how this new version of you operates, and execute that plan. \n\n It’s the work you’re avoiding, the habits you’re refusing to develop, and the beliefs that hurt to change. \n\n It’ll be painful, but so will the feeling of staying the same. \n\n And this is the only way through. \n\n Talk tomorrow, \n\n Ben \n\n ​ Read my previous emails here. ​\n\n ​",

You don’t understand that most things are temporary and there are few universal truths. \n\n But because you’ve fully convinced yourself that your way is the right way, when you encounter a situation where that belief is challenged, you take it as a threat. \n\n It’s why someone who follows the college, 9-5 route gets angry when they see a 16-year-old with their annual salary on their wrist. \n\n And on the contrary, it’s why a struggling entrepreneur feels the need to criticize 9-5ers so they can solidify that they made the right choice in their own mind. \n\n There’s a sliver of doubt that they’re attempting to cover up by denying that any alternative could be true. \n\n But that’s the thing – the alternative can almost always be true. \n\n One thing I know with 100% certainty is that my outlook on life will change over time. It’s supposed to. \n\n Different seasons in life bring additional perspectives. \n\n I’m not saying you should lack conviction in your current beliefs if you’ve thoughtfully crafted them. \n\n Just understand that they may change over time. \n\n Don’t marry your beliefs, or you’ll end up bitter when you see someone succeeding in a different lane than you. \n\n There are a million ways to win. Choose yours. \n\n Alright, I gotta go to boxing, and you gotta watch this video. ​ \n\n Happy Friday, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

You test until something works for you,\r\neven if it goes against the “proven system” that cornballs on the\r\ninternet give you.\r\n\r\nOne of the copywriters I consulted with got his first couple of\r\nclients by digging through Youtubers channels, finding their\r\nemail addresses, and pitching them via email.\r\n\r\nNo one taught him that. But that’s ingenuity.\r\n\r\nThe first time I heard the word “ingenious,” I had just broken\r\ninto my high school gym to play basketball.\r\n\r\nThere was a hidden key in the storage closet to turn the lights\r\non and lower the hoops. I’d found it months before, but one day,\r\nI walked in there, and it was gone.\r\n\r\n“Goddamnit, Terry,” I thought to myself. She was the athletic\r\ntrainer who would always kick me out because it was a liability\r\nfor a minor to be in the gym without supervision.\r\n\r\nI bent the metal part of an old lanyard I found in my backpack\r\nand made a new key. It worked.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Terry walked in right after I used my makeshift\r\nkey to get the baskets down.\r\n\r\nShe asked how I did it, and I told her I had made a new key.\r\nThat’s when she said, “Well, that was ingenious of you.”\r\n\r\nIn my head, I was like “fuck yeah it was Terry.”\r\n\r\nAnyway, I’m rambling, but if you’re stuck right now, BE CRAFTY.\r\nBE INGENIOUS.

A step up from “the homie” even. \n\n When someone has the traits above, they \"make it\" — even if they’re not the most skilled. \n\n My mentor when I was building my basketball trainer SMMA used to always say that if we can get someone laughing on a sales call, they will close. \n\n It's a high ROI tip — in a world of cookie-cutter, boring, lifeless robots, be expressive. Crack the borderline offensive joke. Tell your prospect they need to hire you so they can afford better wifi when their connection cuts out on the Zoom call. \n\n Smile. And be handsome. \n\n I got carried away writing this first point and now I forget the other things that were on my mind. \n\n Hmmm. \n\n I’m sitting outside at Starbucks and another corporate drone just rode by on a scooter. \n\n Oh, next thing that that I was thinking about: \n\n 2. If getting clients is a struggle, you’re being a bot. \n\n This relates to my first point but THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. \n\n “I can’t get any clients, I’ve been sending the same retarded pitch to everyone for 3 months and no one replies.” \n\n CHANGE YOUR PITCH. \n\n Test shit. That’s life. You test until something works for you, even if it goes against the “proven system” that cornballs on the internet give you. \n\n One of the copywriters I consulted with got his first couple of clients by digging through Youtubers channels, finding their email addresses, and pitching them via email. \n\n No one taught him that. But that’s ingenuity. \n\n The first time I heard the word “ingenious,” I had just broken into my high school gym to play basketball. \n\n There was a hidden key in the storage closet to turn the lights on and lower the hoops. I’d found it months before, but one day, I walked in there, and it was gone. \n\n “Goddamnit, Terry,” I thought to myself. She was the athletic trainer who would always kick me out because it was a liability for a minor to be in the gym without supervision. \n\n I bent the metal part of an old lanyard I found in my backpack and made a new key. It worked. \n\n A few days later, Terry walked in right after I used my makeshift key to get the baskets down. \n\n She asked how I did it, and I told her I had made a new key. That’s when she said, “Well, that was ingenious of you.” \n\n In my head, I was like “fuck yeah it was Terry.” \n\n Anyway, I’m rambling, but if you’re stuck right now, BE CRAFTY. BE INGENIOUS. DONT BE A LUKE BELMAR IMAN GHADZI ANDREW TATE CLONE. STEAL YOUR GRANDMAS COMPUTER. SELL YOUR KIDNEY ON THE BLACK MARKET. SEND THE MAFIA TO A PROSPECTS HOUSE. \n\n Ok, thanks for reading all this, now go here to uncover the secrets of the Universe. ​\n\n Talk tm, sorry for yelling. \n\n Bye, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

Everest to me. So I’ll probably wait until the sole starts to\r\nfall off or my toes bust through the mesh.\r\n\r\nI was walking back home after my run when I ran into my friend\r\nBo. Bo is a copywriter that Mason and I have been coaching for\r\nthe last six months or so.\r\n\r\nShe quickly reached $10k per month inside Mason's program, the\r\nCopy MBA Inner Circle, and then started asking me for help\r\nscaling further.\r\n\r\nWith my help she’s scaled past $50k per month by turning her\r\ncopywriting business into a full stack info agency.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, I was thinking about how we could create more\r\nsuccess stories like hers.\r\n\r\nShe started by learning the skill of copywriting and then added\r\nmany of the other services that I offer to clients.\r\n\r\nThings like funnel building, VSLs, webinars, and building all the\r\nsystems on the backend.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this is the common path for those who get the best\r\nresults when first starting out as a beginner.\r\n\r\nThey get good at copy and then expand their skill set to become\r\nmore valuable to their clients.\r\n\r\nThis gave me the idea to partner up with Mason inside of Copy\r\nMBA.\r\n\r\nOver the last few weeks, I’ve been building out course content to\r\nadd to the program, and I’m nearly ready to launch it.\r\n\r\nIf you’re just starting out, this is gonna be a cheat code for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nNot only will you get access to Mason and his team, along with\r\nall of the existing content inside of there…\r\n\r\nBut you’ll also begin to learn the skills that you’ll need to\r\nknow to eventually be able to charge clients up to $40k in a\r\nsingle month the way I have.\r\n\r\nI’m putting the final touches on everything, and because you’re\r\non this list, you’ll get first access to it once it goes live.\r\n\r\nI can promise you with full certainty that if you’re a complete\r\nbeginner who’s looking to build a copywriting business, this is\r\ngonna be the most valuable resource you have at your disposal.\r\n\r\nI’ll be giving you more info in the coming emails.\r\n\r\nFor now, go here and check out this video that’ll help you\r\ndevelop a magnetic aura and make other people love you.

    "body": "I started writing this in my head during my morning run. \n\n The trail was abnormally crowded today. \n\n I had to weave through an abundance of slow walkers, oblivious dog owners, strollers, and preoccupied middle-aged Hispanic men. \n\n It was windy, to the point that the water from the Miami River to my left was blowing up onto the walkway. \n\n The trees were rattling, but I pierced through the wind in my white Nikes, which I’ve been wearing for the past year. \n\n It’s definitely time to buy a new pair, but completing minuscule tasks like going to the shoe store feels equivalent to climbing Mt. Everest to me. So I’ll probably wait until the sole starts to fall off or my toes bust through the mesh. \n\n I was walking back home after my run when I ran into my friend Bo. Bo is a copywriter that Mason and I have been coaching for the last six months or so. \n\n She quickly reached $10k per month inside Mason's program, the Copy MBA Inner Circle, and then started asking me for help scaling further. \n\n With my help she’s scaled past $50k per month by turning her copywriting business into a full stack info agency. \n\n A few weeks ago, I was thinking about how we could create more success stories like hers. \n\n She started by learning the skill of copywriting and then added many of the other services that I offer to clients. \n\n Things like funnel building, VSLs, webinars, and building all the systems on the backend. \n\n It seems like this is the common path for those who get the best results when first starting out as a beginner. \n\n They get good at copy and then expand their skill set to become more valuable to their clients. \n\n This gave me the idea to partner up with Mason inside of Copy MBA. \n\n Over the last few weeks, I’ve been building out course content to add to the program, and I’m nearly ready to launch it. \n\n If you’re just starting out, this is gonna be a cheat code for you. \n\n Not only will you get access to Mason and his team, along with all of the existing content inside of there… \n\n But you’ll also begin to learn the skills that you’ll need to know to eventually be able to charge clients up to $40k in a single month the way I have. \n\n I’m putting the final touches on everything, and because you’re on this list, you’ll get first access to it once it goes live. \n\n I can promise you with full certainty that if you’re a complete beginner who’s looking to build a copywriting business, this is gonna be the most valuable resource you have at your disposal. \n\n I’ll be giving you more info in the coming emails. \n\n For now, go here and check out this video that’ll help you develop a magnetic aura and make other people love you. ​ \n\n Happy Sunday, and thanks for reading, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. If you’re interested in the program I outlined above, hit ‘reply’ real quick and let me know. \n\n ​\n​\n\n ​",

I go to school that 70% gorl. I join frat to seem\r\nnormal so I get mor gorl. I go gym to get big and strwong so gorl\r\nlike me.”\r\n\r\nBecause he was a robot, he took a very direct approach to the\r\nabove goal.\r\n\r\nHe thought that all of the things above would make him desirable.\r\n\r\nAnd while he did have some ‘success,’ Joes intentions became\r\nclear to anyone with half a brain.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t pledge a fraternity because he wanted to make genuine\r\nfriends; he did so to make it look like he had friends.\r\n\r\nHe was obsessed with the gym because, in his mind, it would make\r\nhim desirable to women.\r\n\r\nRobo-Joe tried to cover up his intentions by becoming your\r\ntypical jacked frat bro.\r\n\r\nAnd he wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, so it didn’t really\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFun fact: our wardens actually made him play brain games for 20\r\nminutes a day and report back with his progress because he was\r\nquite slow.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I’m telling you all about Robo-Joe because this is the\r\napproach most people take when they want something.\r\n\r\nLet’s say you want to get your first client and decide that\r\nyou’re just gonna spam DM a bunch of people without doing any\r\nresearch on who they are or what you should offer them.\r\n\r\nYou do that for 3 months, and it doesn’t work because you’re\r\nretarded so you quit.\r\n\r\nThat’s the direct Robo-Joe approach.\r\n\r\nLet’s talk about the better way to get what you want…\r\n\r\nThe first five info-product clients I got were all online\r\nbasketball trainers.\r\n\r\nI went 4/4 on outreach, and one of them (who had half a million\r\nfollowers) reached out to me first.\r\n\r\nSo, to make it clear, I sent four messages and got five clients,\r\nwhich is statistically impossible if you’re not named Ben Bader.\r\n\r\nThe reason this worked wasn’t because of my script or even any\r\ncrazy case study.\r\n\r\nIt was because of two things:\r\n\r\n* I existed on the internet. I was posting content about\r\nbasketball trainer marketing and running ads.\r\n* I used my brain to reach out at the right time. If they posted\r\na new offer or something that I thought I could help with on\r\ntheir story, that’s when I’d send a DM.\r\n\r\nActually, I guess I lied — the third element was that I was half\r\ndecent at writing copy and providing the other services I was\r\noffering, so I was confident in the way I spoke to them.\r\n\r\nThat’s the anti-robot approach. It might sound like it’ll take\r\nlonger, but it diminishes your need to get lucky by spam DM’ing a\r\nbunch of people.\r\n\r\nI don’t know if there was any saving Robo-Joe, but if he had put\r\nthe time into becoming someone who was desirable to women instead\r\nof trying shallow fixes to fake it, maybe he would’ve had a shot.\r\n\r\n​Anyway, I figured out the key to happiness and share it with you\r\nin this video.

    "body": "I was just writing a separate email to you, but I got stuck halfway through. \n\n Now I’ve opened up a new blank page, and hopefully this time, I’ll be able to fill it with enough words to create a coherent email. \n\n My fingers keep trying to drift to one of the other 30 tabs I have open on my computer to distract me from writing this. \n\n I guess while we’re here, I’ll tell you about my new partnership with Copy MBA. ​\n\n You may know of my friend Cardinal Mason. \n\n He has a coaching program teaching people how to build a copywriting business. \n\n A few years ago, we did a podcast together while I was living in Tulum, Mexico. \n\n He was making around $40k per month as a copywriter, and I was spinning my wheels trying to scale my basketball trainer marketing agency. \n\n I remember thinking to myself that I could do what he was doing and make more money than I was then. \n\n I didn’t realize it then, but the next month, I got my first copywriting client. \n\n It was an online basketball trainer named Ganon Baker. \n\n He had tens of thousands of social media followers, and I came in to write ad scripts, run his email marketing, and write a new VSL script. \n\n He was paying me $2,500 per month for all of this, which I was stoked about because I’d previously been working with clients who paid me just $1k per month. \n\n Next thing you know, I was working with 3 of the other big online basketball trainers. \n\n One of them was a guy named Jordan Lawley, who has over half a million followers on Instagram. \n\n I remember him telling me on our first call that he wanted to work with me because he liked the copy in one of the ads I wrote. \n\n This was the foundation of the business I run now which has allowed me to hit $100k months. \n\n I used my copywriting ability to land clients and then started offering other services to them. \n\n Things like I mentioned above, like ads, email automations, and video scripts. \n\n Plus, building funnels, backend systems, and helping manage their sales teams. \n\n It was the addition of these skills that allowed me to get clients on rev share deals and charge up to $45k/month. \n\n But it all started with copy. \n\n And that’s why I think it’s the most valuable skill anyone can learn as a beginner. \n\n The Copy MBA Inner Circle is the best place to start. \n\n Mason will give you everything you need to know to become a proficient copywriter, and you’ll also get access to my course, which will teach you the additional skills I’ve used to scale my business. \n\n I made a video talking about this new partnership, which you can watch here. ​\n\n See you over there, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Here’s my recent YT video on how I got my first client ​\n\n ​",

Any fun weekend plans???\r\n\r\nHahaha.\r\n\r\nGrow up.\r\n\r\nIt’s such a beautiful day here that I feel bad for anyone who\r\nisn’t in the state of Florida.\r\n\r\nBesides those who are in Orlando. Or even worse… Tampa. Ew.\r\n\r\nImagine the highlight of your city being a predatory theme park\r\nor a place called “Meat Market.”\r\n\r\nAt least Tampa has “The Edition” - a 3.5-star hotel in any major\r\ncity, but seems to be the main attraction since there’s nothing\r\nelse to do there. They also only employ members of the LGBTDJKD\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nI’m not trying to be homophobic, but members of this community\r\ndon’t seem to have the best work ethic, so things tend to take\r\nlonger at this hotel. However, they are very good at making\r\nlattes.\r\n\r\nAnyway I’m sitting outside Starbucks, sipping on a cold brew with\r\nvanilla cream and sugar, and thinking about how much of a\r\nhypocrite I am.\r\n\r\nI just got jealous of a homeless man because he looked happy and\r\nhad really good posture.\r\n\r\nI can’t help but judge the man a couple tables away from me\r\nwearing a suit on his lunch break.\r\n\r\nI started off this email by making fun of those who look forward\r\nto Fridays and weekends, but I’d be lying if I said my mood isn’t\r\nslightly better on days like this.\r\n\r\nAnd if I actually followed the majority of the advice I give on\r\nthe internet, I’d be a billionaire by now.\r\n\r\nA wise man once said, “The most honest people are hypocrites.”\r\n\r\nThe wise man who said that is the same one who’s writing this\r\nemail.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re still reading by now you’re probably wondering\r\nwhere the lesson is or what I’m gonna “teach” you here.\r\n\r\nMy goal is not to teach but rather entertain.\r\n\r\nThe richest people are the entertainers. Think about Tate. His\r\nmessage wasn’t something that others hadn’t said prior.\r\n\r\nBut he blew up because the guy is just outrageous. The way he\r\nspeaks, the stories he tells, and the unapologetic expression of\r\nhis thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt was refreshing to see someone who genuinely seemed not to care\r\nif people didn’t agree with him while simultaneously saying what\r\neveryone else was thinking.\r\n\r\nOn another note, most of the successful people I know are really\r\nlazy when they’re uninterested.\r\n\r\nMyself included — I’ve always had a really hard time doing things\r\nI don’t want to do.\r\n\r\nI’ll wait until the final deadline, half-ass the project, cheat\r\noff the Asian kid, and do everything I can to get by while\r\nputting in minimal effort.\r\n\r\nBut when I’m bought in and find something that I’m interested in,\r\nI turn into an autistic computer engineer.\r\n\r\nI can spend hours at my desk without losing focus. It occupies my\r\nmind constantly.\r\n\r\nMaybe you’re the same.\r\n\r\nOne thing I’ve started to understand about this is that obsession\r\nis created, not found.\r\n\r\nYou don’t “stumble” upon something you’re passionate about.\r\n\r\nBut rather, you create that passion by diving into a project and\r\nlearning to love the mundane tasks that come with it.\r\n\r\nOk, I gotta hop on a call, but before I go, I’m feeling generous\r\ntoday, so I’m giving $100 to a random subscriber who watches and\r\ncomments on my recent YT video.\r\n\r\n​Go here and watch this video (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluew470l3hnh4v2mvvbph29lx000h6/7qh7h8hod5vd8waz/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9OWGFNYktTcDdLMA==\r\n) (leave a comment with your favorite thing I said in the video).\r\n\r\nConsidering my audience is still relatively small, you have like\r\na 1/10 chance of winning probably.\r\n\r\nBye love you,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

They also only employ members of the LGBTDJKD community. \n\n I’m not trying to be homophobic, but members of this community don’t seem to have the best work ethic, so things tend to take longer at this hotel. However, they are very good at making lattes. \n\n Anyway I’m sitting outside Starbucks, sipping on a cold brew with vanilla cream and sugar, and thinking about how much of a hypocrite I am. \n\n I just got jealous of a homeless man because he looked happy and had really good posture. \n\n I can’t help but judge the man a couple tables away from me wearing a suit on his lunch break. \n\n I started off this email by making fun of those who look forward to Fridays and weekends, but I’d be lying if I said my mood isn’t slightly better on days like this. \n\n And if I actually followed the majority of the advice I give on the internet, I’d be a billionaire by now. \n\n A wise man once said, “The most honest people are hypocrites.” \n\n The wise man who said that is the same one who’s writing this email. \n\n And if you’re still reading by now you’re probably wondering where the lesson is or what I’m gonna “teach” you here. \n\n My goal is not to teach but rather entertain. \n\n The richest people are the entertainers. Think about Tate. His message wasn’t something that others hadn’t said prior. \n\n But he blew up because the guy is just outrageous. The way he speaks, the stories he tells, and the unapologetic expression of his thoughts. \n\n It was refreshing to see someone who genuinely seemed not to care if people didn’t agree with him while simultaneously saying what everyone else was thinking. \n\n On another note, most of the successful people I know are really lazy when they’re uninterested. \n\n Myself included — I’ve always had a really hard time doing things I don’t want to do. \n\n I’ll wait until the final deadline, half-ass the project, cheat off the Asian kid, and do everything I can to get by while putting in minimal effort. \n\n But when I’m bought in and find something that I’m interested in, I turn into an autistic computer engineer. \n\n I can spend hours at my desk without losing focus. It occupies my mind constantly. \n\n Maybe you’re the same. \n\n One thing I’ve started to understand about this is that obsession is created, not found. \n\n You don’t “stumble” upon something you’re passionate about. \n\n But rather, you create that passion by diving into a project and learning to love the mundane tasks that come with it. \n\n Ok, I gotta hop on a call, but before I go, I’m feeling generous today, so I’m giving $100 to a random subscriber who watches and comments on my recent YT video. \n\n ​ Go here and watch this video (leave a comment with your favorite thing I said in the video). \n\n Considering my audience is still relatively small, you have like a 1/10 chance of winning probably. \n\n Bye love you, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. If you want me to help you build a copywriting or “growth operator” business, check this out. ​\n\n ​",

Or maybe\r\nyou don’t fully respect yourself because you’ve found success\r\nthrough nefarious means.\r\n\r\nBecause of these factors, you aren’t the type of person that\r\nother amazing, genuine people want to be around.\r\n\r\nYou end up attracting shallow people into your life – guys who\r\nwould slander your name if it’s in their best interest and a girl\r\nwho would leave your table at the club to go to Futures table\r\n(rip).\r\n\r\nYou see a lot of these types in Miami and they’re usually dripped\r\nout in Chrome Hearts.\r\n\r\nThese are people who “beat the system.”\r\n\r\nThey found the financial success that others dream of, perhaps\r\nwithout having to go through the usual hardship or personal\r\ndevelopment process.\r\n\r\nBut they don’t get to fully enjoy the money because they haven’t\r\nbecome the person who is worthy of incredible relationships, as\r\nyou attract what you are.\r\n\r\nAnd even if you “earn” all the money in the world, you still have\r\nto earn your relationships.\r\n\r\nLaying on the beach in Barbados means nothing if you aren’t with\r\npeople you love.\r\n\r\nDriving your dream car through the Hollywood hills doesn’t hit\r\nthe same if the girl in your passenger seat only likes you for\r\nyour money.\r\n\r\nOpening your banking app to a number that would allow you to\r\nretire at any moment feels empty when you don’t like the person\r\nwhose face you see in the reflection of your screen.\r\n\r\nYour relationships are everything and there are no shortcuts that\r\nwill earn you respect.\r\n\r\nSo if you’re in the trenches right now and you feel like you’re\r\nnot reaping the rewards of your efforts…\r\n\r\nCongratulations. You’re in the process of developing into the\r\nperson who is worthy of the reality that you want.\r\n\r\nSorry for the hiatus. Good to be back,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "All of the best things in life are earned. \n\n This is especially true for men and is something that you’ll constantly be reminded of as you “level up.” \n\n There are no shortcuts. \n\n True genuine friendships, the girl who loves and admires you, and the impact on other people are all things that you cannot access by finding a loophole. \n\n You have to become “him.” \n\n Money alone won’t do this for you. \n\n There is one thing that usually has the biggest impact on the quality of experience you get to access. \n\n And it’s your relationships. \n\n First with yourself and then with others. \n\n Let’s say you get “lucky” financially. \n\n You hit a big crypto rug pull, you run scam eCom brands, or you start selling Viagra to old men and pimp out your grandmother on OF. \n\n It works, and you get “access” to all the money you could need, which, in theory, will buy you the best experiences that life has to offer. \n\n But there’s this deep-seated belief in your head that feels like you’re unworthy. \n\n While you earned the money you wanted you didn’t improve your relationship with yourself along the way. \n\n Maybe your back was never against the wall and you didn’t develop the grit that comes with digging yourself out of a hole. Or maybe you don’t fully respect yourself because you’ve found success through nefarious means. \n\n Because of these factors, you aren’t the type of person that other amazing, genuine people want to be around. \n\n You end up attracting shallow people into your life – guys who would slander your name if it’s in their best interest and a girl who would leave your table at the club to go to Futures table (rip). \n\n You see a lot of these types in Miami and they’re usually dripped out in Chrome Hearts. \n\n These are people who “beat the system.” \n\n They found the financial success that others dream of, perhaps without having to go through the usual hardship or personal development process. \n\n But they don’t get to fully enjoy the money because they haven’t become the person who is worthy of incredible relationships, as you attract what you are. \n\n And even if you “earn” all the money in the world, you still have to earn your relationships. \n\n Laying on the beach in Barbados means nothing if you aren’t with people you love. \n\n Driving your dream car through the Hollywood hills doesn’t hit the same if the girl in your passenger seat only likes you for your money. \n\n Opening your banking app to a number that would allow you to retire at any moment feels empty when you don’t like the person whose face you see in the reflection of your screen. \n\n Your relationships are everything and there are no shortcuts that will earn you respect. \n\n So if you’re in the trenches right now and you feel like you’re not reaping the rewards of your efforts… \n\n Congratulations. You’re in the process of developing into the person who is worthy of the reality that you want. \n\n Sorry for the hiatus. Good to be back, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Go here if you want my help in building a copywriting or \"growth operating\" business. ​\n\n P.P.S. I’m thinking about putting together a program for coaches, consultants, and course sellers who are under $100k per month. In there, I will give you the systems that we use to scale clients up to $600k/month. If this is something you might be interested in, hit reply and let me know. \n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

    "body": "I'm sitting at my favorite coffee shop watching an asian man in a\r\nyankees hat have an episode.\r\n\r\nHe's sitting about 10 feet to my right in a white tank top with\r\nblack shorts and his legs crossed.\r\n\r\nThere are three empty bottles of corona in front of him and he\r\njust knocked one over.\r\n\r\nHe's now struggling to open his black leather backpack.\r\n\r\nPart of me hopes he’s reaching for a weapon because this would be\r\nthe perfect time for me to become a hero. I'm seated slightly\r\nbehind him so he wouldn’t see me coming.\r\n\r\nPlus he can’t be more than 140 pounds and one right hook to the\r\ntemple should knock him out.\r\n\r\nDamnit. no weapon, just airpods.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment I sat down he’s been talking abnormally loud.\r\n\r\nMost of which has been mumble nonsense but at one point he asked\r\nthe man in the floral shirt at the table in front of him if he\r\ncould come sit with him.\r\n\r\nThe man politely declined.\r\n\r\nHe just took a final sip out of each of his three bottles and is\r\nnow flailing his arms above his head.\r\n\r\nSmoke break. He put a cigarette in his mouth and walked outside.\r\n\r\nThis is fun. It's usually only homeless people that you get to\r\nsee have outbursts like this.\r\n\r\nOther than a few staff members, no one else in the restaurant has\r\neven noticed him.\r\n\r\nEveryone is just in their own little bubble, dealing with their\r\nown ambitions, obstacles, and problems.\r\n\r\nI guess if there’s a lesson here it’s that letting the opinions\r\nof others stop you from doing something you want is so silly.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you’re gonna die one day.\r\n\r\nSecond of all, who cares what they think.\r\n\r\nAnd third, they’re probably not even gonna notice you.\r\n\r\nOur friend is back from his smoke break.\r\n\r\nHe asked for another beer and the waiter reluctantly told him\r\nthat they aren’t legally allowed to serve more than three\r\nalcoholic beverages.\r\n\r\nI wonder if that’s true or if he was just worried that this guy\r\nwas gonna start dancing on the table.\r\n\r\nInstead the waiter went and got him some water. The manic man got\r\nup and gave him a hug.\r\n\r\nHe drunkenly said, “Thank you. I’ve had such a rough day,”\r\ngrabbed his things and walked out with hope in his stride.\r\n\r\nAw. What a nice happy ending.\r\n\r\nI guess everyone’s dealing with their own shit and it's not good\r\nfor us to judge.\r\n\r\nAnyway – This video is one of my favorites and it’s something\r\nthat helped me go from being a normal college kid to building my\r\ndream life over the last 4 years.

    "body": "I'm sitting at my favorite coffee shop watching an asian man in a yankees hat have an episode. \n\n He's sitting about 10 feet to my right in a white tank top with black shorts and his legs crossed. \n\n There are three empty bottles of corona in front of him and he just knocked one over. \n\n He's now struggling to open his black leather backpack. \n\n Part of me hopes he’s reaching for a weapon because this would be the perfect time for me to become a hero. I'm seated slightly behind him so he wouldn’t see me coming. \n\n Plus he can’t be more than 140 pounds and one right hook to the temple should knock him out. \n\n Damnit. no weapon, just airpods. \n\n From the moment I sat down he’s been talking abnormally loud. \n\n Most of which has been mumble nonsense but at one point he asked the man in the floral shirt at the table in front of him if he could come sit with him. \n\n The man politely declined. \n\n He just took a final sip out of each of his three bottles and is now flailing his arms above his head. \n\n Smoke break. He put a cigarette in his mouth and walked outside. \n\n This is fun. It's usually only homeless people that you get to see have outbursts like this. \n\n Other than a few staff members, no one else in the restaurant has even noticed him. \n\n Everyone is just in their own little bubble, dealing with their own ambitions, obstacles, and problems. \n\n I guess if there’s a lesson here it’s that letting the opinions of others stop you from doing something you want is so silly. \n\n First of all, you’re gonna die one day. \n\n Second of all, who cares what they think. \n\n And third, they’re probably not even gonna notice you. \n\n Our friend is back from his smoke break. \n\n He asked for another beer and the waiter reluctantly told him that they aren’t legally allowed to serve more than three alcoholic beverages. \n\n I wonder if that’s true or if he was just worried that this guy was gonna start dancing on the table. \n\n Instead the waiter went and got him some water. The manic man got up and gave him a hug. \n\n He drunkenly said, “Thank you. I’ve had such a rough day,” grabbed his things and walked out with hope in his stride. \n\n Aw. What a nice happy ending. \n\n I guess everyone’s dealing with their own shit and it's not good for us to judge. \n\n Anyway – This video is one of my favorites and it’s something that helped me go from being a normal college kid to building my dream life over the last 4 years. ​\n\n See you over there, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "There are two types of people in this world. \n\n The first type of person is the one who hesitates to start a business because they’re worried about how they’d pay taxes if they were to make money. \n\n They sit there and think about every possible problem that they could possibly run into. \n\n “What happens if I get a client and then they ask me to do something that I don’t know how to do?” \n\n These are the types that want a “full step-by-step playbook” to start a business. \n\n It’s like they’re taking the 9-5er approach to business and need to be told what to do every step of the way. \n\n There’s an acronym that accurately describes this type: \n\n NGMI (not gonna make it). \n\n They’re effectively toddlers. \n\n The second type of person is the one who adopts a different mindset. \n\n Sure, they still have hesitations, fears and doubts. \n\n And they don’t know what every step of the staircase will look like. \n\n But they take action despite these factors. \n\n There’s a different acronym that they follow: \n\n FITFO (figure it the fuck out). \n\n Yesterday I found a perfect example of these two people in the comment section of one of my Youtube videos. \n\n One person commented “This video is ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY POINTLESS” and right underneath him was a comment that read: \n\n “Exactly what I’m going through rn. Your YouTube was really put in my life for a reason. The timing of this video is impeccable” \n\n Can you guess who’s who in this example? \n\n Sure I’m biased because it’s my own video but this was interesting to me. \n\n How can two people watch the same exact video and have completely opposite reactions? \n\n Perception. \n\n Your reality is colored by the lens in which you view the world. \n\n If you think someone is coming to save you, or you think there’s a step by step system that everyone who “makes it” follows, you will find information that lacks training wheels useless. \n\n Instead you’ll watch hyper edited videos that follow a script and have gay animations over them. \n\n You’ll get a dopamine rush and think you’re doing something useful. \n\n But you’ll never actually find success because you’re type one. \n\n You need everything to be predictable – which is the opposite of entrepreneurship. \n\n On the contrary, if you understand that anything worth having takes time and that your reality lies on your shoulders alone, you will eventually achieve your desired result. \n\n And when you consume information that reminds you of this, instead of getting angry that you weren’t handed an “A-Z blueprint” you’ll feel inspired that others see the world the same way you do. \n\n Every day you have the power to choose which of these two people you want to be. \n\n One will serve you and push you towards your goals. \n\n And the other will keep you stuck in the same mindset that has gotten you nowhere. \n\n Choose wisely. \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

Swishes only.” \n\n I think to myself “this mf crazy, I need a new trainer.” \n\n But I keep shooting, now aiming only for nylon. \n\n The ball hits the back of the rim and goes in. Doesn’t count. \n\n Front rim. Side rim. Rattles in off the glass. \n\n Doesn’t matter, I’m running. \n\n “This is ridiculous. I’m literally making these shots and still being forced to run,” I complain to myself. \n\n But then something cool happens. \n\n I find the sweet spot and the ball stops hitting the rim. \n\n The way I’m shooting feels different now. \n\n I’m no longer just aiming for the basket. \n\n I’m aiming for a very specific part of the back of the net. \n\n I’m conscious of exactly how the ball has to leave my fingertips. \n\n Everything is incredibly precise. \n\n I’ve reached a level of attention to detail and focus that I wasn’t accessing previously. \n\n This is the difference between good and great. \n\n It’s what keeps some business owners stuck at $10k, $50k, or $100k per month. \n\n It’s what causes tens of thousands of dollars worth of leads to fall through the cracks in a sales process. \n\n And it’s what created the opportunity for me to make 7 figures as a marketer for info-product businesses. \n\n I get paid to fill in the gaps. \n\n To improve the copy, or the sales process, or the video script. \n\n I bring a new level of attention to minor details and make an extra 6 figures a month for my clients. \n\n They pay me a percentage of it. \n\n This is how you win as a service provider for coaching business. \n\n Find the broken piece(s) of their business. \n\n Identify a solution using your critical thinking ability. \n\n Get paid. \n\n For example if an usually low amount of leads end up on sales calls, my job is to find the crack in the system. \n\n Maybe the email sequence sucks or there’s none at all. \n\n Maybe the leads aren’t getting dialed. \n\n Maybe the video sales letter is horrible. \n\n Maybe there’s a lack of congruence between the content and the messaging on the funnel. \n\n Whatever the problem is, the way to make money is to identify and fix it. \n\n Boom, now you’re a valuable piece to any coaching business. \n\n You’re turning good, into great. \n\n ​ Congrats, that’s how the money is made. ​ \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

Start taking actions that will move you towards said thing. \n\n I’m frequently reminded of this when I make content. \n\n Since I’ve developed the Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday, Youtube video schedule, I start getting ideas on these days. \n\n It begins when I consciously decide, “Okay, I need to make a video today.” \n\n As I continue thinking about what I want to talk about, sometimes my subconscious will throw me a random thought. \n\n I’ll be on a walk or in the shower and boom. \n\n I figure out what I want to talk about. \n\n I could keep going on about this but I have to leave for dinner so maybe we can revisit another day. \n\n ​ Here was today’s thought by the way. ​\n\n Okay love you bye, \n\n Ben \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "Yo bo,\r\n\r\nLet’s talk about data.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I hate numbers.\r\n\r\nI cheated in every math class I ever took.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes only data can reveal a clear answer when things are\r\nstagnant or you’re not getting a result you want.\r\n\r\nThis can be quite obvious when looking at quantifiable data.\r\n\r\nIf you’re spending $10k on ads and only making $5k back, clearly\r\nthere's an issue.\r\n\r\nAny reasonable person who doesn’t want to lose money would then\r\ntry to figure out the problem.\r\n\r\nTo do this, they’d look at the more granular data.\r\n\r\nThe click through rate, cost per click, cost per impressions,\r\nconversion rate, etc.\r\n\r\nUsing this data, they’d attempt to identify the problem and test\r\na solution.\r\n\r\nRinse and repeat.\r\n\r\nThis is a pragmatic, data-driven approach that will result in\r\nobjective truths.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re not progressing in a certain area of your life the\r\nway you want to, this is what you need to apply.\r\n\r\nLet’s say you’ve been trying to put on muscle for 6 months.\r\n\r\nYour approach hasn’t been very meticulous and you stepped on the\r\nscale today and saw that you’ve only gained 2 pounds.\r\n\r\nAs a sensible person, capable of critical thought, what would you\r\ndo in this scenario?\r\n\r\nAnswer in your head real quick.\r\n\r\nIf you said something along the lines of “I’d audit what I’m\r\neating and how I’m working out, and see what needs to be\r\nchanged,” you’ve come up with a solid answer.\r\n\r\nNow for whatever reason, this ability to analyze data gets\r\nforgotten when the data is less quantifiable.\r\n\r\nMeaning if you’ve been in a situation you don’t like for an\r\nextended period of time.\r\n\r\nWhether it’s:\r\n\r\nTrying to start a business and not making much progress\r\n\r\nStagnating in your business\r\n\r\nLack of growth on social media\r\n\r\nOr even in your personal life:\r\n\r\nMaybe you’ve been wanting to improve a relationship, you’ve had a\r\nlist of hobbies that you wanted to try but haven’t, or you want\r\nto build better habits…\r\n\r\nWhatever that thing is, you eventually need to take an objective\r\nlook under the hood.\r\n\r\n“Why am I not solving this problem I have? What are the variables\r\nthat go into the problem?

    "body": "Yo {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Let’s talk about data. \n\n Personally, I hate numbers. \n\n I cheated in every math class I ever took. \n\n But sometimes only data can reveal a clear answer when things are stagnant or you’re not getting a result you want. \n\n This can be quite obvious when looking at quantifiable data. \n\n If you’re spending $10k on ads and only making $5k back, clearly there's an issue. \n\n Any reasonable person who doesn’t want to lose money would then try to figure out the problem. \n\n To do this, they’d look at the more granular data. \n\n The click through rate, cost per click, cost per impressions, conversion rate, etc. \n\n Using this data, they’d attempt to identify the problem and test a solution. \n\n Rinse and repeat. \n\n This is a pragmatic, data-driven approach that will result in objective truths. \n\n And if you’re not progressing in a certain area of your life the way you want to, this is what you need to apply. \n\n Let’s say you’ve been trying to put on muscle for 6 months. \n\n Your approach hasn’t been very meticulous and you stepped on the scale today and saw that you’ve only gained 2 pounds. \n\n As a sensible person, capable of critical thought, what would you do in this scenario? \n\n Answer in your head real quick. \n\n If you said something along the lines of “I’d audit what I’m eating and how I’m working out, and see what needs to be changed,” you’ve come up with a solid answer. \n\n Now for whatever reason, this ability to analyze data gets forgotten when the data is less quantifiable. \n\n Meaning if you’ve been in a situation you don’t like for an extended period of time. \n\n Whether it’s: \n\n Trying to start a business and not making much progress \n\n Stagnating in your business \n\n Lack of growth on social media \n\n Or even in your personal life: \n\n Maybe you’ve been wanting to improve a relationship, you’ve had a list of hobbies that you wanted to try but haven’t, or you want to build better habits… \n\n Whatever that thing is, you eventually need to take an objective look under the hood. \n\n “Why am I not solving this problem I have? What are the variables that go into the problem? If I were to solve this problem, what would need to change?” \n\n And just like that, you’ve given yourself action steps to execute on. \n\n Don’t forget to look at the data in your life and perform mini-audits. \n\n Be pragmatic, and find the objective truth. \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I finished recording the last few modules of the Artisan Lab today. \n\n It has basically become a digital version of my brain. \n\n Here’s some of the info inside: \n\n How I’ve built my agency to 6 figures/month How we’ve scaled info businesses to $500k/month+ My full copywriting guide I’ve used to generate millions The daily habits & routine that took me from being an average college kid to successful entrepreneur Plus a lot more. \n\n Thinking about launching it in the next couple days.

I honestly don’t care if he closes or not. \n\n But it’d be really cool if I could flex on all of you who’ve been doing outreach for a while. \n\n Imagine you’re working your ass off sending 30 pitches a day. \n\n And then you see me, scrolling through tik tok in my pajamas when I find your ideal client. \n\n I open my laptop, click the loom button and start rambling about how we’ve made a lot of clients a lot of moneys. \n\n Next thing you know I’m on a call with your ideal client and he loves me. \n\n We talk about the weather and he tells me about his favorite spots in Miami when he was my age. \n\n I show him the keys to my Porsche 911 turbo and then tell him I can help him make the equivalent of 3 of them in a month. \n\n He’s wowed. \n\n I pitch a price 100x the average growth operator or copywriters net worth. \n\n He says “YES!!!” and asks if he can add a tip. \n\n I receive the wire on the call, my team builds him a new funnel, and we make him $1m next month. \n\n Hahahaha. \n\n That would be cool. \n\n I shared this whole outbound process (including the loom and email I sent) inside the Artisan Lab btw. ​\n\n I didn’t expect to write a rather arrogant email to you today, but here we are. \n\n It would also be funny if this whole thing blew up in my face. \n\n I’ll keep you updated. \n\n This inspired me to start doing outbound again. It’s kind of fun. \n\n Anyway, you can apply to join my mastermind here if you want to get a behind the scenes look at it all. ​\n\n Talk to you tomorrow, \n\n Ben\n​ \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

I honestly don’t care if he closes or not.\r\n\r\nBut it’d be really cool if I could flex on all of you who’ve been\r\ndoing outreach for a while.\r\n\r\nImagine you’re working your ass off sending 30 pitches a day.\r\n\r\nAnd then you see me, scrolling through tik tok in my pajamas when\r\nI find your ideal client.\r\n\r\nI open my laptop, click the loom button and start rambling about\r\nhow we’ve made a lot of clients a lot of moneys.\r\n\r\nNext thing you know I’m on a call with your ideal client and he\r\nloves me.\r\n\r\nWe talk about the weather and he tells me about his favorite\r\nspots in Miami when he was my age.\r\n\r\nI show him the keys to my Porsche 911 turbo and then tell him I\r\ncan help him make the equivalent of 3 of them in a month.\r\n\r\nHe’s wowed.\r\n\r\nI pitch a price 100x the average growth operator or copywriters\r\nnet worth.\r\n\r\nHe says “YES!!!” and asks if he can add a tip.\r\n\r\nI receive the wire on the call, my team builds him a new funnel,\r\nand we make him $1m next month.\r\n\r\nHahahaha.\r\n\r\nThat would be cool.\r\n\r\nI shared this whole outbound process (including the loom and\r\nemail I sent) inside the Artisan Lab btw.

And you’re still here, so that means maybe you’re having fun with me. \n\n I’ve never deliberately “practiced” my copywriting ability, I just wrote. \n\n I started sending emails to this list in September 2021. \n\n There were probably 6 people who’d subscribed, including my 4 burner emails, my mother, and grandma. \n\n On top of that, I was effectively an autistic Chinese child who didn’t speak a word of English (if that offended you, grow up). \n\n I had no idea what I was talking about, nothing to sell, and very few people who cared to listen to what I was saying. \n\n But I started anyway. \n\n I developed my own style, my writing became more clear, and I began articulating the ideas that were rattling around in my head. \n\n Along with the newsletter, I was consistently tweeting and journaling. \n\n This was the “training camp” that prepared me to work with clients. \n\n I’d read a few copywriting books, I practiced every day (even though it didn’t feel like practice), and I became half-decent at this writing thing. \n\n It’d be impossible not to. \n\n One of my favorite copywriting books is The Boron Letters by Gary Halbert. \n\n The reason I like it is because it feels personal (he wrote it to his son while he was in jail). \n\n Instead of writing in a super authoritative tone, it reads as if it’s a journal with insights and tips sprinkled throughout. \n\n You can tell he clearly enjoys writing and isn’t putting any pressure on himself to be grammatically correct or follow any rules. \n\n This is how you have to practice. \n\n Write about your day. \n\n Write about something you enjoy. \n\n Write about how you overcame a difficult time in your life. \n\n Write about the weird crush you have on your cleaning lady (creep). \n\n It doesn’t matter what you write about, as long as you find a way to enjoy it, and it doesn’t feel like work. \n\n Ok? \n\n Ok. \n\n Enough for today. \n\n ​ Join me in the Artisan Lab if you want to get rich. ​\n\n If you don’t want to join me in there, that’s fine. But at least reply and tell me you made it all the way down here to make me feel good. \n\n Thanks, \n\n Ben \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "Happy Monday.\r\n\r\nOn my walk this morning I overheard a guy talking about the\r\nhospitality industry.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like times are tough right now.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine who works in nightlife told me the same thing\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\nAllegedly, a lot of the bigger clubs and restaurants are losing\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nLike, lots of money.\r\n\r\nI began thinking about how complex it must be to run a\r\nhospitality group.\r\n\r\nBetween staffing, opening new locations, logistics, operations\r\nand a myriad of other factors I’m probably overlooking.\r\n\r\nAnd then finally on top of all that, the most important piece;\r\nmarketing.\r\n\r\nYou have to deal with all of these annoying logistical issues and\r\neven once you solve all of them, you will still fail if you don’t\r\nget people in the doors.\r\n\r\nThat does not sound like a fun time.\r\n\r\nLet’s compare this to an online service based business or\r\ncoaching business.\r\n\r\nThere are two main objectives in each of these.\r\n\r\n1. Create an attractive, in-demand offer.\r\n\r\n2.

Create an attractive, in-demand offer. \n\n 2. Generate demand. \n\n It’s actually the same process of building a club or restaurant, without the world of complexity attached to it. \n\n With an internet business, all you have to do is learn some skills and build the offer. \n\n That can take a week. \n\n And basically costs nothing. \n\n Once the offer is built, you can dedicate the majority of your focus to acquisition. \n\n If your content gets attention, or you build a lucrative outbound system, or you can profitably put a dollar into Facebook and get $2 back, scaling becomes easy. \n\n You double down on the acquisition system and you make sure nothing breaks on the backend. \n\n Next thing you know, you have a $5m/year business that was built off a couple TikTok videos, loom pitches, or cringy ads. \n\n Obviously I’m oversimplifying this a bit, but it really is this simple. \n\n You lose when you try to make it more complicated. \n\n If you’re struggling to grow as a service provider or a coach, one of two things are happening. \n\n 1.

Pain kills you instantly.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe that’s what you need.\r\n\r\nHappy Monday,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. Join me inside my mastermind if you’re ready to grow.

    "body": "Up until my junior year of high school, I was dead set on playing college basketball. \n\n Being a “hooper” was my entire identity. \n\n But over the previous year, some doubt had started to creep in. \n\n “Maybe this isn’t right for me anymore,” a voice in my head would tell me. \n\n I tried to ignore it, but it wouldn’t go away. \n\n When I’d consider what life would be like if I decided not to play collegiately, it was daunting. \n\n All of my friends and family knew me as this basketball guy. \n\n It’s how I viewed myself. \n\n How embarrassing would it be to change that? \n\n I’d look like a crazy person. \n\n And I had no idea what’s on the other side. \n\n But I couldn’t shake that feeling in my gut that knew it was time for a different route. \n\n In a single moment, I made the decision. \n\n I was no longer going to play in college. \n\n It was time to let that story go and when I did, I became free. \n\n “Walking away from anything you love because it’s not working for you is the only character building exercise there is. People can't comprehend how much you have to screw yourself over to get self respect.” - Brute \n\n It’s no secret that change is difficult. \n\n Changing your habits is painful. \n\n Changing your career path is painful. \n\n Changing your negative thought patterns is painful. \n\n Because of this, most people elect to endure situations that aren’t right for them in order to avoid the pain that comes with change. \n\n Sure, working a job you hate sucks, but quitting that job to bet on yourself would be temporarily more painful than staying in it. \n\n Your willingness to exchange this low level, long term pain for high level, short term pain is what makes you grow. \n\n You choose to dig the hole a little deeper. \n\n You choose to put yourself in a tough situation. \n\n You choose to sacrifice your (illusionary) peace for struggle. \n\n And then you’re free. \n\n It’ll be difficult and even after making the decision your ego will try to pull you back into comfort. \n\n But if you can withstand that tide, you’ll make it to the other side as a new person. \n\n Comfort kills you slowly. Pain kills you instantly. \n\n And maybe that’s what you need. \n\n Happy Monday, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Join me inside my mastermind if you’re ready to grow. ​ \n\n P.P.S.

Do I need to start taking viagra? Am I developing cataracts? \n\n Oh no. \n\n I’m going to New York with my friends Jimmy and Mason today. \n\n We have quite the weekend planned, but if I told you about it, I’d have to kill you. \n\n I don’t think I could ever live in NY. \n\n I have one major flaw and it’s that I’m geographically challenged. \n\n I don’t know what body of water I’m looking at off my balcony right now. \n\n I don’t know if I’m facing east, west, north, south, or upside down. \n\n I don’t know how to get nearly anywhere without a GPS. \n\n Miami is relatively small and I have a hard enough time navigating it. \n\n I can’t imagine how lost I’d be in New York. \n\n Plus I’d have a bunch of angry neurotic people yelling at me. \n\n Speaking of, the other day I watched a clip of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David. \n\n They were talking about Seinfeld, and how it was “a show about nothing.” \n\n This is an email about nothing. \n\n Well actually, I guess I do have something to tell you: \n\n Sorry. \n\n I’ve been slacking on Youtube. \n\n I was growing really quickly at first, then I hit a plateau, and got too caught up in the numbers. \n\n My focus went from “how can I make content that I enjoy?” \n\n To “how can I hook these stupid little lizard brained monkeys into watching more of my video so the algorithm pushes it?” \n\n And that took the fun out of it. \n\n I’m gonna get back on there and stop worrying about the metrics, I promise. \n\n But it might be a few days because there’s a solid chance I get lost in New York. \n\n Anyway, here’s my last thought for you today: \n\n You can always find a reason to stress when you tie your sense of self to your accomplishments. \n\n In that sense, you’ll never be complete. \n\n Sure, this can be a way to motivate yourself but it also stains every experience with jaded glasses. \n\n You’ll be in the club in New York with a dozen models around you and your favorite song playing as you dance with your best friends. \n\n But you won’t be all the way there. \n\n There will be a part of you that’s anxious, worrying about how you don’t have $100m yet. \n\n Instead, learn to accept what is. \n\n You’re on your journey and that’s that. \n\n Stressing doesn’t fix anything, so you might as well be where you are. \n\n Congrats. You’ve completed this email about nothing. \n\n Let me know if you made it all the way down here. \n\n See you in NY, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Join my mastermind here. ​\n\n ​ \n\n ​ \n\n ​\n​",

Learn copywriting \n\n Read books, watch Youtube videos, and start writing sample copy. \n\n You can improve quickly, you just have to get reps. \n\n Writing on Twitter or pretending you have your own email list can also be helpful. \n\n Study good copy and your subconscious will recognize patterns. \n\n But DO NOT overthink this. \n\n You don’t have to be the best writer in the world, you just have to be competent. \n\n 2.

(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/38umv9xlk7ukhok4qqvhrh4nzx2nns7/08hwh9hd535pvmul/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9iZW5vbmJ1c2luZXNzLw==\r\n)\r\n\r\nThere were too many questions to get through all of them on IG,\r\nso I’ll be answering more here.\r\n\r\nLet’s get it:\r\n\r\nWhat’s something about you that hasn’t changed after being\r\nfinancially free?\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nMoney doesn’t change you, it serves as a tool that allows you to\r\nbe more of who you already were.\r\n\r\nI’ve become more comfortable expressing my true self as I’ve had\r\nfinancial success.\r\n\r\nIt was always there, I just didn’t have the confidence to show it\r\nuntil I proved to myself that I could design my life however I\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nDid your college friends get what you were doing at the time you\r\ndropped out?\r\n\r\nSort of.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t know all the details, but they knew I was running\r\nsome form of marketing business.\r\n\r\nNot to throw shade at all, but I was actually surprised how few\r\nof them were curious enough to ask.\r\n\r\nOnce they graduated and started normal jobs, more have reached\r\nout asking for info.\r\n\r\nDo you do low and high ticket offers with your clients that make\r\nover $100k/month?\r\n\r\nAlmost all high ticket offers.\r\n\r\nIn 95% of cases, having a low ticket offer is quite dumb.\r\n\r\nOnly caveats are when its purpose is to liquidate ad spend, the\r\npersonal brand has a huge audience, or the offer doesn’t have a\r\ndirect ROI (teaching a hobby).\r\n\r\nHow do you lock in and work when you don’t feel like it?\r\n\r\nI’ve always been horrible at doing things I don’t want to do.\r\n\r\nBut my biggest leaps in business have been made when I can get\r\nover that initial resistance.\r\n\r\nStarting anything from scratch is difficult.\r\n\r\nThat’s natural. If you expect it to be easy, you’ll quit.\r\n\r\nBut on the other side of resistance, you start moving with the\r\ntide.\r\n\r\nThe work starts to feel like peace and you develop this love for\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt’s one of the most beautiful emotional states that you can\r\naccess in life.\r\n\r\nBut you have to earn it by getting over that resistance in the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nSo either do the work, or be a pussy forever lol.\r\n\r\nOk last one - there were a bunch of questions about doing\r\noutreach.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the problem.\r\n\r\nYou’re looking for an “outreach system.”\r\n\r\nThis is why every pitch I see absolutely sucks.\r\n\r\nYou’re trying to rush the process as if you’re attempting to get\r\na girl to go home with you 3 minutes into a date.\r\n\r\nIt’s creepy and you didn’t demonstrate any value or status.\r\n\r\nWhy would someone trust you?\r\n\r\nThe only outreach tip you’ll ever need is to use your brain.\r\n\r\nIf you’re competent, you’ll figure out a way to get in touch with\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not, well someones gotta flip the burgers.\r\n\r\nI know that’s a bit harsh but it’s the truth.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all the questions, sorry if I didn’t get to\r\nyours.\r\n\r\n​Anyway, check out this new interview I did with Sean, one of my\r\nmastermind members.

    "body": "I did a Q&A yesterday on new business Instagram (follow here). \n\n There were too many questions to get through all of them on IG, so I’ll be answering more here. \n\n Let’s get it: \n\n What’s something about you that hasn’t changed after being financially free? \n\n Nothing. \n\n Money doesn’t change you, it serves as a tool that allows you to be more of who you already were. \n\n I’ve become more comfortable expressing my true self as I’ve had financial success. \n\n It was always there, I just didn’t have the confidence to show it until I proved to myself that I could design my life however I wanted. \n\n Did your college friends get what you were doing at the time you dropped out? \n\n Sort of. \n\n They didn’t know all the details, but they knew I was running some form of marketing business. \n\n Not to throw shade at all, but I was actually surprised how few of them were curious enough to ask. \n\n Once they graduated and started normal jobs, more have reached out asking for info. \n\n Do you do low and high ticket offers with your clients that make over $100k/month? \n\n Almost all high ticket offers. \n\n In 95% of cases, having a low ticket offer is quite dumb. \n\n Only caveats are when its purpose is to liquidate ad spend, the personal brand has a huge audience, or the offer doesn’t have a direct ROI (teaching a hobby). \n\n How do you lock in and work when you don’t feel like it? \n\n I’ve always been horrible at doing things I don’t want to do. \n\n But my biggest leaps in business have been made when I can get over that initial resistance. \n\n Starting anything from scratch is difficult. \n\n That’s natural. If you expect it to be easy, you’ll quit. \n\n But on the other side of resistance, you start moving with the tide. \n\n The work starts to feel like peace and you develop this love for progress. \n\n It’s one of the most beautiful emotional states that you can access in life. \n\n But you have to earn it by getting over that resistance in the beginning. \n\n So either do the work, or be a pussy forever lol. \n\n Ok last one - there were a bunch of questions about doing outreach. \n\n And this is the problem. \n\n You’re looking for an “outreach system.” \n\n This is why every pitch I see absolutely sucks. \n\n You’re trying to rush the process as if you’re attempting to get a girl to go home with you 3 minutes into a date. \n\n It’s creepy and you didn’t demonstrate any value or status. \n\n Why would someone trust you? \n\n The only outreach tip you’ll ever need is to use your brain. \n\n If you’re competent, you’ll figure out a way to get in touch with people. \n\n If you’re not, well someones gotta flip the burgers. \n\n I know that’s a bit harsh but it’s the truth. \n\n Thanks again for all the questions, sorry if I didn’t get to yours. \n\n ​ Anyway, check out this new interview I did with Sean, one of my mastermind members. ​ \n\n He’s making $30k/mo working with some big names like Charlie Morgan and Joel Kaplan. \n\n See you over there, \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​",

    "body": "Hey bo,\r\n\r\nI’m sitting on my balcony writing to you on a beautiful day here\r\nin Miami.\r\n\r\nThere’s a common dilemma that everyone faces when trying to build\r\na business.\r\n\r\nIt’s the thing that drastically slows down or halts progress\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s this idea that business has to be complicated.\r\n\r\nWe often look for complex solutions to simple problems in order\r\nto avoid action.\r\n\r\nOdds are, you know what step you need to take right now.\r\n\r\nIf you’re trying to get clients in the info-product space, it’s\r\npretty simple:\r\n\r\n1. Learn about copywriting and marketing\r\n\r\n2. Start doing as much quality outreach as possible\r\n\r\n3. Close a client, get good results and repeat\r\n\r\nBut maybe you’re telling yourself you’re not ready.\r\n\r\nYou need to learn more or find some outreach system that you’re\r\ncurrently unaware of.\r\n\r\nThat’s your mind playing tricks on you.\r\n\r\nIn reality, you’re scared to start because you don’t know what\r\nyou don’t know.\r\n\r\nAnd committing to this process will require you to step into a\r\nnew version of yourself.\r\n\r\nIt’s the version of you who doesn’t hesitate and knows you can\r\nfigure things out on the fly.\r\n\r\nWith this, comes additional pressure.\r\n\r\n“What if I get a client and run into a problem?”\r\n\r\n“What if my outreach is horrible?”\r\n\r\nIt’s easier to stay where you are (and who you are) now while\r\nfooling yourself into thinking that you’re not ready.\r\n\r\nThere’s a harsh truth of the universe that you need to\r\nunderstand:\r\n\r\nYou will never be entirely prepared for anything.\r\n\r\nThe stars will never align perfectly until you take the imperfect\r\naction.\r\n\r\nYou can wait forever.\r\n\r\nAnd you’ll sit there, watching others who are no different from\r\nyou get the results that you could’ve gotten, if you had the\r\nballs to start.\r\n\r\nThis is something I’ve learned while coaching the members inside\r\nof Artisan Lab. (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/68u8vxpw9qs8hk46m3xhohpk8g0kkh9/e0hph7h0336knlc8/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n)​\r\n\r\nThe biggest value I’m able to provide people with is conviction.\r\n\r\nBecause they’ve paid me for coaching, they value the messenger\r\nmore than the message.\r\n\r\nMeaning if I just confirm to someone that the logical action is\r\nright (even if they already knew that) my conviction and\r\nassurance is enough to get them to actually do it.\r\n\r\nThe secret is understanding that there is no secret, and you’re\r\nas prepared now as you’ll ever need to be.\r\n\r\nIt’s a cliche, but an accurate one.\r\n\r\nProgress is simple.\r\n\r\nJust actually do the thing that you know you need to do.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I dropped this video yesterday that people seem to really\r\nenjoy.

    "body": "Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n I’m sitting on my balcony writing to you on a beautiful day here in Miami. \n\n There’s a common dilemma that everyone faces when trying to build a business. \n\n It’s the thing that drastically slows down or halts progress entirely. \n\n And it’s this idea that business has to be complicated. \n\n We often look for complex solutions to simple problems in order to avoid action. \n\n Odds are, you know what step you need to take right now. \n\n If you’re trying to get clients in the info-product space, it’s pretty simple: \n\n 1. Learn about copywriting and marketing \n\n 2. Start doing as much quality outreach as possible \n\n 3. Close a client, get good results and repeat \n\n But maybe you’re telling yourself you’re not ready. \n\n You need to learn more or find some outreach system that you’re currently unaware of. \n\n That’s your mind playing tricks on you. \n\n In reality, you’re scared to start because you don’t know what you don’t know. \n\n And committing to this process will require you to step into a new version of yourself. \n\n It’s the version of you who doesn’t hesitate and knows you can figure things out on the fly. \n\n With this, comes additional pressure. \n\n “What if I get a client and run into a problem?” \n\n “What if my outreach is horrible?” \n\n It’s easier to stay where you are (and who you are) now while fooling yourself into thinking that you’re not ready. \n\n There’s a harsh truth of the universe that you need to understand: \n\n You will never be entirely prepared for anything. \n\n The stars will never align perfectly until you take the imperfect action. \n\n You can wait forever. \n\n And you’ll sit there, watching others who are no different from you get the results that you could’ve gotten, if you had the balls to start. \n\n This is something I’ve learned while coaching the members inside of Artisan Lab. ​ \n\n The biggest value I’m able to provide people with is conviction. \n\n Because they’ve paid me for coaching, they value the messenger more than the message. \n\n Meaning if I just confirm to someone that the logical action is right (even if they already knew that) my conviction and assurance is enough to get them to actually do it. \n\n The secret is understanding that there is no secret, and you’re as prepared now as you’ll ever need to be. \n\n It’s a cliche, but an accurate one. \n\n Progress is simple. \n\n Just actually do the thing that you know you need to do. \n\n Anyway, I dropped this video yesterday that people seem to really enjoy. ​ \n\n See you over there, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Here’s your last chance to get into Artisan Lab before the price goes up ​ \n\n ​\n​",

That’s way more than I would’ve made in my first year out of college,” I thought to myself. \n\n That feeling of hopefulness remained as a buzz in the back of my mind for a while. \n\n It’s like I was the chubby, socially off kid on the basketball team who finally gets to play during senior night. \n\n I was just happy to be here. \n\n But at some point, that wore off. \n\n Unfortunately, it all worked and I got most of the things I wanted… Maybe a little too easily. \n\n Perhaps my vision for what I’d want after accomplishing my current status didn’t evolve fast enough. \n\n I guess that’s an easy thing to overlook when you begin to embark on any journey – What do I do if it works? \n\n In the past, my goals would naturally evolve. \n\n There was a point where I just wanted to make $5k per month. \n\n Once I got there, I wanted $10k per month and so on, all the way up to six figures a month. \n\n It was easy to keep going. That was until money stopped impacting my lifestyle. \n\n I already don’t have to think about expenses, I go on trips when I want, and I have my dream car. \n\n I could triple my income and it would have a minimal impact on my day to day life. \n\n But that’s where the goals have to evolve. \n\n More money now means more security. \n\n It means I can invest more and set up my future self and my perfect 10 wife, so we can have beautiful babies that go to the league. \n\n It means I can take care of and employ more people. \n\n That was never in the vision. \n\n I just wanted the flashy shit and fun lifestyle. \n\n But that part was surprisingly easy. \n\n This might read like I’m spoiled and ungrateful, but I’m sharing this because you will likely reach a point in your journey where you complete your vision. \n\n You’ll get everything that you believed was possible for you and find yourself in a position where life feels a bit dull, even though it might look exciting externally. \n\n That’s when you have to move the goal post back again. \n\n Find a new north star and begin working towards it. \n\n See you at the top, \n\n Ben \n\n PS - Go here to get 1 on 1 help from me and scale your info-product agency ​ \n\n PPS - Lmk if you made it all the way down here and liked this one :)\n​ \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

Anything can work, if you take the time to be creative and stand out in your pitches. Take initiative in solving issues that are in the best interest of the business, even if you are not directly responsible for them. Think for yourself before asking questions. In most cases the answer is obvious and you just need to take the obvious action. Your conscious brain is typically not your friend. When you find yourself thinking that you need more information before you can act, you are fooling yourself. If you don’t feel like you’re in over your head, you’re not saying “yes” enough. The best way to learn is on the fly. Do not obsess over systems and processes. Make money first, worry about efficiency later. Non-scalable actions differentiate you from your “competition.” Everyone can send dozens of mediocre pitches daily. Not everyone will take the time to correctly assess a situation and personalize a pitch to solve a specific problem. Not every client is going to be a homerun. There are two sides to the equation and if your client isn’t holding up their end of the bargain, there’s only so much you can do. Find a way to get your foot in the door. It can make sense to offer one service, perform well, and take over other parts of their business once you earn their trust and have a better understanding of the gaps in their business. The best opportunities are found when a client is making good money, despite the fact that their systems are being overlooked. Fixing those problems is like pouring gas on the flame. There we have it.\n\n Remember these 10 things and you'll be driving an SVJ in no time.\n\n ​ And if you want my personal help in growing your info-product agency or coaching business, click here. ​\n\n See you at the top,\n\n Ben\n\n ​",

Neither can anyone else.\n\n We’re all different people with various natural advantages and inclinations.\n\n That’s life.\n\n The ones who are rewarded are those who act despite the fact that there is no universal rulebook.\n\n You just gotta start moving and trust that you’ll find the answers while you’re running the race.\n\n There’s no way around this truth.\n\n ​ Trust yourself, and you’ll be rewarded. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​",

I made a banger Youtube video with my friend Phillip who turned $1 into millions of dollars. You can check it out here. ​\n\n ​",

The business was growing, but life felt a bit dull.\n\n So throughout 2024, I sort of fucked off.\n\n I realized that I could still make solid money without being at my desk all day.\n\n My income fluctuated from $60K-$140k/mo throughout the year.\n\n I’ve been maintaining – but not growing.\n\n Now I’ve reached a point where I feel the same way I did towards the end of my “grind phase,” except it’s reversed.\n\n I want to work more.\n\n Sure, I can maintain my current income level with minimal effort, but what happens if I push?\n\n I want another supercar. I want a penthouse. I want to invest $50k/mo.\n\n In that order, lol.\n\n This speaks to the seasons in life. I’m glad I turned on “cruise control” for a while because it reignited my visceral urge to get richer.\n\n So now, we’re here.\n\n If you’re in the same boat and you want to put all 3 of your feet on the gas heading into the new year, this video will give you a blueprint. ​\n\n I’ve never been more bullish on the opportunities inside of the online education space.\n\n And I’ll show you how you can get a sliver of this $180 billion market…\n\n To locking in,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. This industry will make you a millionaire in 2025 ​\n\n ​\n​\n​",

Plus a case study you can use to get more clients.\n\n There’s your 0-$100k/month blueprint.\n\n I know it sounds simple.\n\n The only part that’s more complicated is the identification of bottlenecks.\n\n Once you get a client, you have to be able to correctly assess the levers which need to be pulled to scale them.\n\n And before that, you have to determine if they’re even in a position that will allow them to scale.\n\n In Artisan Lab, you’ll learn how to do all of this.\n\n You’ll know who to reach out to, what a high quality pitch looks like, what to offer, how to close the deal, and how to make your clients a boatload of money.\n\n ​ Go here now and apply to join the winning team :) ​\n\n Talk soon,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

Your dream life awaits.\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. I just created what’s likely the most informative Youtube video I’ve ever posted.\n\n It’ll show you step by step how to land a great client that you can actually get results for.\n\n Then how to scale with them and leverage that case study to get more clients and scale past $20k/month.\n\n And in the process, you’ll beat the resistance that’s holding you back.\n\n ​ Go here to watch the video now. ​\n\n ​\n​",

Wrap around floor to ceiling windows. And more\r\nspace than I know what to do with.\r\n\r\nDuring my search, I found this penthouse for $19k/mo.\r\n\r\nIt’s 2,500 square feet, marble floors, huge living area, big\r\nbalcony etc.\r\n\r\nBasically everything I want.\r\n\r\nTo move there, I’d pay at least $10k to break my current ($5k/mo)\r\nlease.\r\n\r\nThen another $30k+ furnishing the new place.\r\n\r\nAnd then obviously my rent would quadruple.\r\n\r\nIt’s not that I couldn’t do it, but it would sting.\r\n\r\nAnd that pissed me off.\r\n\r\nThere’s something I want.\r\n\r\nAnd I can’t get it.\r\n\r\nBecause it’s too… expensive?\r\n\r\nMy fingers hurt just typing the word expensi– I can’t do it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAm I a child?\r\n\r\nShould I start asking permission to go to the bathroom too?\r\n\r\nThis lit a fire under me.\r\n\r\nMy lease is up in July and by then, I want to be in a position\r\nwhere I can spend $15k+ on rent without batting an eye.\r\n\r\nIf I can’t, I’ve dishonored my entire bloodline.\r\n\r\nPeople often tell you to find a strong “why” – some altruistic\r\nmotive that drives you.\r\n\r\nAnd while I’m motivated by actualizing my potential and being\r\nable to take care of the people around me, sometimes that’s not\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nMy family isn’t in poverty.\r\n\r\nMom’s already retired and my Dad has more money in cars than most\r\ndo in savings.\r\n\r\nI don’t need to rescue anyone.\r\n\r\nSo sometimes, I’ll lean on superficial things as a source of\r\nmotivation.\r\n\r\nI’ll picture myself hopping out of a new supercar and walking\r\ninto my penthouse.\r\n\r\nAnd guess what?\r\n\r\nIn case no one’s ever told you this, allow me — it’s okay to want\r\nwhat you want.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not motivated, maybe you’re just not being honest with\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nYou listened to dorks online tell you that you can’t want the\r\nflashy lifestyle.\r\n\r\nNow you’re mad at your parents for raising you in a good home\r\nbecause you don’t have a strong enough “why.”\r\n\r\nBe real with yourself. If you want to make money so you can\r\nhangout with baddies on the beach all day, then work really hard\r\nso you can do exactly that.

And more space than I know what to do with.\n\n During my search, I found this penthouse for $19k/mo.\n\n It’s 2,500 square feet, marble floors, huge living area, big balcony etc.\n\n Basically everything I want.\n\n To move there, I’d pay at least $10k to break my current ($5k/mo) lease.\n\n Then another $30k+ furnishing the new place.\n\n And then obviously my rent would quadruple.\n\n It’s not that I couldn’t do it, but it would sting.\n\n And that pissed me off.\n\n There’s something I want.\n\n And I can’t get it.\n\n Because it’s too… expensive ?\n\n My fingers hurt just typing the word expensi– I can’t do it again.\n\n Am I a child?\n\n Should I start asking permission to go to the bathroom too?\n\n This lit a fire under me.\n\n My lease is up in July and by then, I want to be in a position where I can spend $15k+ on rent without batting an eye.\n\n If I can’t, I’ve dishonored my entire bloodline.\n\n People often tell you to find a strong “why” – some altruistic motive that drives you.\n\n And while I’m motivated by actualizing my potential and being able to take care of the people around me, sometimes that’s not enough.\n\n My family isn’t in poverty.\n\n Mom’s already retired and my Dad has more money in cars than most do in savings.\n\n I don’t need to rescue anyone.\n\n So sometimes, I’ll lean on superficial things as a source of motivation.\n\n I’ll picture myself hopping out of a new supercar and walking into my penthouse.\n\n And guess what?\n\n In case no one’s ever told you this, allow me — it’s okay to want what you want.\n\n If you’re not motivated, maybe you’re just not being honest with yourself.\n\n You listened to dorks online tell you that you can’t want the flashy lifestyle.\n\n Now you’re mad at your parents for raising you in a good home because you don’t have a strong enough “why.”\n\n Be real with yourself. If you want to make money so you can hangout with baddies on the beach all day, then work really hard so you can do exactly that. ​\n\n Sure, at some point you’ll probably need a deeper reason to keep pushing.\n\n But that’s not a worry right now.\n\n ​ Get to the bag. You’ll find your purpose along the way.\n\n I’ll see you in the Penthouse,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

Set an objective\n\n 2. Identify potential solutions\n\n 3. Implement immediately\n\n 4. Get data\n\n 5. Make necessary adjustments\n\n The faster you do this, the faster you find success.\n\n I have very few closely held beliefs but this is one I’m sure of.\n\n Have an idea?\n\n Act on it.\n\n The voice telling you that you don’t know where to start is natural.\n\n It’s impossible to know because you don’t have the necessary data.\n\n The only way to get data is through trial and error.\n\n And when you make action your default state, you get data a hell of a lot quicker.\n\n Here’s an example:\n\n Ellis joined Artisan Lab 7 days ago.\n\n Yesterday, he got a new client.\n\n ​ Are there some potential obstacles that he might not know how to solve right now?\n\n Yes.\n\n But he’ll find the solution once he acquires more data.\n\n Same with Phillip, who just signed a client on a 20% rev share.\n\n ​ Winners win because they take action quicker than losers.\n\n They learn on the fly and adapt as they go.\n\n ​ You can join the winning team and get access to the same system they’re using to close deals by going here. ​\n\n Or you can remain on the sidelines and keep making excuses.\n\n It’s all up to you, my friend.\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

The slow lane\n\n Try to figure everything out on your own.\n\n Spend hours combing through YouTube.\n\n Feel lost, almost quit, but finally begin to figure it out after a year or two.\n\n This works, but it’s more difficult. Plus you’ll be in the far right lane with all the civics and minivans.\n\n 2. The fast lane\n\n This is where you find the shortcuts.\n\n Where one piece of advice can save you six months of uncertainty.\n\n And one connection can lead to a world of opportunity.\n\n You have a clear path to follow and mentors who’ve been where you aim to go.\n\n Your investment serves as a contract with yourself – you’re fully committed this time.\n\n This lane is for the Porsches, Lambos, and Ferraris.\n\n And inside of Artisan Lab, we're built for speed.\n\n No bullshit. No filler. Just a direct path to results.\n\n My students are closing 5-figure clients within weeks, not years.\n\n They're scaling to $30k, $40k, and $50k months while others are still watching YouTube videos.\n\n But here's the thing…\n\n Tonight, at midnight the price increases.\n\n You're going to win either way.\n\n But why take the scenic route when you could be in the fast lane?\n\n ​ Lock in the current price before midnight tonight. ​\n\n Fasten your seatbelt, my friend.\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. I put together a document outlining everything you’ll get inside the program.\n\n ​ You can check it out here. ​\n\n P.P.S.

(Not like you had a choice anyway.)\r\n\r\nPrompt:\r\n\r\nWrite and email about why most people fail when trying to start a\r\nbusiness in the info/agency world.\r\n\r\nBenGPT:\r\n\r\n\"Hey bo,\r\n\r\nHere’s the part they don’t tell you in those “how I made\r\n$100K/month” YouTube videos:\r\n\r\nMost people don’t fail because of strategy.\r\n\r\nThey fail because they’re fucking soft.\r\n\r\nThey read Russell Brunson, buy a cold email course, slap together\r\nan offer, and post 3 times on Twitter.\r\n\r\nThen wonder why clients aren’t lining up to wire them $5K.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the guy who is getting clients?\r\n\r\nHe’s not smarter than you. Or more talented. Or even better\r\nlooking (unless it’s me, in which case, sorry bro).\r\n\r\nHe just didn’t stop.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, most people enter the info/agency game with all the\r\nwrong expectations.\r\n\r\nThey think:\r\n\r\n* It’s gonna be passive.\r\n* It’s gonna be fast.\r\n* It’s gonna feel good.\r\n\r\nWrong, wrong, and LOL.\r\n\r\nWhat it’s gonna feel like is:\r\n\r\nRewriting your VSL script 7 times and still hating it.\r\n\r\nGetting ghosted by 33 different leads in a row.\r\n\r\nHaving a panic attack after realizing you owe Stripe $1,200 in\r\nfees.\r\n\r\nThis is not a business for people who crave comfort.\r\n\r\nThis is a business for psychos.\r\n\r\nThe type who’ll build a landing page at 2am just because he had a\r\nweird idea in the shower.\r\n\r\nIf that’s not you – cool.\r\n\r\nGo get a job. Live a peaceful life. Watch Netflix and pay rent\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nBut if it is you?\r\n\r\nThen you need to stop acting like a confused beginner and start\r\nbehaving like someone who’s already successful.\r\n\r\nBecause here’s the truth:\r\n\r\nThere are only 3 things that actually matter when starting your\r\nagency/info-biz:\r\n\r\n* A skill that solves a painful problem\r\n* A system that gets that skill in front of people\r\n* The brain damage tolerance to repeat that until rich\r\n\r\nThat’s it.\r\n\r\nEverything else is masturbation.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need another course.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need a better logo.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to ask your group chat for feedback on your offer\r\ndoc.\r\n\r\nYou just need to move.\r\n\r\nFast. Messy. Relentless. Like your future depends on it – because\r\nit does.\r\n\r\nBen\"\r\n\r\n[End]\r\n\r\nPretty solid, yeah?\r\n\r\nAnd that was with a half-baked, one-sentence prompt.\r\n\r\nObviously there’s still some magic that comes from real-life\r\nexperiences, fresh insights, and having a pulse.\r\n\r\nBut voice-wise?\r\n\r\nI’d say it’s 90% of the way there.\r\n\r\nHere’s the coolest part:\r\n\r\nI now have a repeatable framework I can use with every client.\r\n\r\nImport their data.

    "body": "I don’t want to do this.\n\n But I have to show you something…\n\n I’ve been training Claude and ChatGPT on my writing style for about a week.\n\n It’s gotten to the point where I could go live in a cabin in Alaska, spend all day with Alpacas, and if AI-me kept emailing you…\n\n You’d probably never notice.\n\n So let’s run an experiment:\n\n I’ll come up with an idea for an email.\n\n Give AI a lazy one-line prompt.\n\n We’ll read it together.\n\n Then I’ll meet you at the end and we’ll talk.\n\n Sound good?\n\n Cool. (Not like you had a choice anyway.)\n\n Prompt:\n\n Write and email about why most people fail when trying to start a business in the info/agency world. \n\n BenGPT:\n\n \"Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Here’s the part they don’t tell you in those “how I made $100K/month” YouTube videos: \n\n Most people don’t fail because of strategy. \n\n They fail because they’re fucking soft. \n\n They read Russell Brunson, buy a cold email course, slap together an offer, and post 3 times on Twitter. \n\n Then wonder why clients aren’t lining up to wire them $5K. \n\n Meanwhile, the guy who is getting clients? \n\n He’s not smarter than you. Or more talented. Or even better looking (unless it’s me, in which case, sorry bro). \n\n He just didn’t stop. \n\n The truth is, most people enter the info/agency game with all the wrong expectations. \n\n They think: \n\n It’s gonna be passive. It’s gonna be fast. It’s gonna feel good. Wrong, wrong, and LOL. \n\n What it’s gonna feel like is: \n\n Rewriting your VSL script 7 times and still hating it. \n\n Getting ghosted by 33 different leads in a row. \n\n Having a panic attack after realizing you owe Stripe $1,200 in fees. \n\n This is not a business for people who crave comfort. \n\n This is a business for psychos. \n\n The type who’ll build a landing page at 2am just because he had a weird idea in the shower. \n\n If that’s not you – cool. \n\n Go get a job. Live a peaceful life. Watch Netflix and pay rent forever. \n\n But if it is you? \n\n Then you need to stop acting like a confused beginner and start behaving like someone who’s already successful. \n\n Because here’s the truth: \n\n There are only 3 things that actually matter when starting your agency/info-biz: \n\n A skill that solves a painful problem A system that gets that skill in front of people The brain damage tolerance to repeat that until rich That’s it. \n\n Everything else is masturbation. \n\n You don’t need another course. \n\n You don’t need a better logo. \n\n You don’t need to ask your group chat for feedback on your offer doc. \n\n You just need to move. \n\n Fast. Messy. Relentless. Like your future depends on it – because it does. \n\n Ben\" \n\n [End] \n\n Pretty solid, yeah?\n\n And that was with a half-baked, one-sentence prompt.\n\n Obviously there’s still some magic that comes from real-life experiences, fresh insights, and having a pulse.\n\n But voice-wise?\n\n I’d say it’s 90% of the way there.\n\n Here’s the coolest part:\n\n I now have a repeatable framework I can use with every client.\n\n Import their data. Feed it the right examples.\n\n And 30 minutes later? Boom -- I have a writing clone that sounds just like them.\n\n If you want to learn how to do the same — I’ll teach you inside Artisan Lab. ​\n\n I’ll be in the cabin.\n\n You bring the alpacas.\n\n See you in Alaska,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

    "body": "I have a slight hangover but it was for a good cause…\r\n\r\nWe celebrated Cardinal Mason’s 26th birthday last night and I\r\ndon’t recall much after midnight.\r\n\r\nHence the later email today.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I’ve been enjoying business a lot recently.\r\n\r\nA few clients are ripping. Artisan Lab is scaling.

And sheep are so dumb that they follow\r\neach other off cliffs.\r\n\r\nI know that’s incredibly convenient for me to say considering I\r\nsell coaching (hence the pitch warning).\r\n\r\nBut I was once one of the idiot sheep.\r\n\r\nNow, I can’t name a single rich friend of mine who hasn’t paid\r\nfor information.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, here are some of the bigger things I’ve\r\ninvested in over the past few years:\r\n\r\nSMMA coaching: $5k (I spent all the money I had on it)\r\n\r\nHigh ticket sales coaching: $2k\r\n\r\nJeremy Haynes Inner Circle: I’ve been paying him for over 2.5\r\nyears. I don’t want to do the math, but it’s close to six\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nIman Gadzhi’s 8FL: $18k\r\n\r\n1-1 coaching: $10k ++\r\n\r\nI’m definitely forgetting a handful of others, but there’s my\r\ndiploma.\r\n\r\nNot once have I felt ripped off, even when I didn’t end up\r\nutilizing much of a program.\r\n\r\nBecause you're not just buying information -- you're bullying\r\nyourself into an identity shift.\r\n\r\nI don’t know if I would’ve ever ‘made it’ online without doing\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nWhen you start paying for info, it's scary.\r\n\r\nThe online cattle love to tell you that all courses are scams.\r\n\r\nThey comment “nice try Diddy” and “put the fries in the bag.”\r\n\r\nYour family members and friends will think you’re involved in a\r\npyramid scheme.\r\n\r\nBut to the universe – and to yourself…\r\n\r\nIt’s a declaration of change.\r\n\r\nAs you type your card info into a Whop checkout page, as some\r\nsweaty 19 year old closer prays you don't leave the zoom call…\r\n\r\nA part of your soul becomes free.\r\n\r\nYou’ll feel a rush of anxiety and excitement.\r\n\r\nYou went against what 95% of people believe to be the norm.\r\n\r\nYou bet on yourself and spent an uncomfortable amount of money to\r\nsolidify that commitment.

I don’t want to do the math, but it’s close to six figures.\n\n Iman Gadzhi’s 8FL: $18k\n\n 1-1 coaching: $10k ++\n\n I’m definitely forgetting a handful of others, but there’s my diploma.\n\n Not once have I felt ripped off, even when I didn’t end up utilizing much of a program.\n\n Because you're not just buying information -- you're bullying yourself into an identity shift.\n\n I don’t know if I would’ve ever ‘made it’ online without doing that.\n\n When you start paying for info, it's scary.\n\n The online cattle love to tell you that all courses are scams.\n\n They comment “nice try Diddy” and “put the fries in the bag.”\n\n Your family members and friends will think you’re involved in a pyramid scheme.\n\n But to the universe – and to yourself…\n\n It’s a declaration of change.\n\n As you type your card info into a Whop checkout page, as some sweaty 19 year old closer prays you don't leave the zoom call…\n\n A part of your soul becomes free.\n\n You’ll feel a rush of anxiety and excitement.\n\n You went against what 95% of people believe to be the norm.\n\n You bet on yourself and spent an uncomfortable amount of money to solidify that commitment. ​\n\n Hopefully you didn’t buy some bullshit.

Artisan Lab’s 1 year anniversary is coming up in 2 days.\n\n I asked our members to leave a quick review and wanted to share this one from Jack: \n\n “48 hours into Artisan Lab hands down one of if not the best purchases in my life. I know I’m glazing rn but honestly wtf it’s gone to a point of over delivering. It’s not just info, it’s every single skill it takes to make money online in one package.” \n\n If only the helicopter company over delivered half as much as we do inside Artisan Lab…\n\n ​ Join us here. ​\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

Good.\r\n\r\nI've made over $2.5M doing this, and my students are crushing it\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nJace made $204k in one month from ONE client.\r\n\r\nDanny went from $5k/month with a bunch of agency clients to\r\n$150k/month with one AI Operating partnership.\r\n\r\nThe reason it works is because it's NOT just a business model.\r\nIt's a skill set that makes you irreplaceable.\r\n\r\nWith this skill set, you become the most valuable person in any\r\npersonal brand's business.\r\n\r\nThis not only allows you to charge revenue shares that pay you\r\nlike a business partner, but it also makes you recession-proof.\r\n\r\nAnd on the free class I'm gonna show you the exact steps you need\r\nto take to put yourself in this position.\r\n\r\nThis can turn you into a money printer. I promise.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, I was a lost frat bro with no direction in life.\r\n\r\nMaking $5k per month sounded like a pipedream.\r\n\r\nI figured the successful people online were either scammers or\r\nthey were smarter than me.\r\n\r\nBut I started taking action, I built my skill set, and now I'm\r\nhere in my Miami penthouse with my dream car.\r\n\r\nAnd I can tell you with 100% certainty, I am no smarter than you.\r\nI've simply made a series of good decisions that have resulted in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nAnd you, b, made a good decision by signing up for the free\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nBut the next decision you have to make is to show up.\r\n\r\nJuly 23rd, 7pm EST.\r\n\r\nSave this link –\r\nhttps://event.webinarjam.com/go/live/3/6rv7mh7fgs2s6 (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8ur65e8vghmuxv38elcghvqxpmllf9hkmlpo/08hwh9h2kn632ehl/aHR0cHM6Ly9ldmVudC53ZWJpbmFyamFtLmNvbS9nby9saXZlLzMvNnJ2N21oN2ZnczJzNg==\r\n)​\r\n\r\nAnd tell your girl she's on her own for dinner because you have\r\nto get rich.\r\n\r\nI promise you won't regret spending your night learning from me.\r\n\r\nExcited to help you grow,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "Let me tell you a story that’ll probably make you question your\r\nlife choices.\r\n\r\nMeet Jace.\r\n\r\n​\r\nHe used to run an SMMA working with real estate agents.\r\n\r\nFound some success, then it all came crashing down when he had to\r\nrefund a bunch of clients.\r\n\r\nBut he didn’t quit – that’d be a rather depressing story and I\r\ndefinitely wouldn’t be writing about him right now.\r\n\r\nInstead, he pivoted.\r\n\r\nWhy work with obnoxious, entitled realtors when you can work with\r\npersonal brands and make more money with less headache?\r\n\r\nRealizing this, Jace decided to dip his toe into the AI Operating\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nNot long after, he got two clients and was making around\r\n$10k/month, but it was inconsistent and he wanted to scale.\r\n\r\nThat’s when he joined Artisan Lab.\r\n\r\nFrom there, it took him six months to get to $50k/month. And just\r\none month later, he made over $90k.\r\n\r\nBut here’s where it gets absolutely insane…\r\n\r\nLast month, Jace made $204k. From ONE client.\r\n\r\n​\r\nNow this isn’t like dropshipping or Amazon FBA where you take\r\nhome 10% of that.\r\n\r\nThis is a high-margin, cash flow business where you’re keeping\r\n60-80% of what you bring in.\r\n\r\nHe now has a few clients, is getting insane results for them, and\r\nhas built a team around himself to scale.\r\n\r\nJace got here by mastering a few key things:\r\n\r\n1. Finding the right clients (info-product businesses with\r\nexisting traffic)\r\n\r\n2. Structuring profitable rev share deals\r\n\r\n3. Building a predictable system that scales\r\n\r\nAnd obviously – working really fucking hard.\r\n\r\nHe went from making roughly $120k per year to over a MILLION\r\nDOLLARS per year in 7 months.\r\n\r\nThis is what I mean when I say AI Operating is replacing\r\ntraditional agencies.\r\n\r\nWhy stack $2k retainers when you can get 30-40% of a\r\nmillion-dollar launch?\r\n\r\nOn the webinar, I’ll break down exactly how Jace (and dozens of\r\nother students) made this transition from grinding for scraps to\r\nlanding these massive revenue share deals.\r\n\r\nJuly 23rd, 7pm EST.\r\n\r\nDon’t miss it,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. Now I can’t promise you the same results as Jace because\r\nfrankly, his results are insane and he’s a maniac (in a good\r\nway).\r\n\r\nBut if you put in the effort and follow the same principles, it’d\r\nbe reasonable to assume you can achieve a fraction of his\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nAnd even a fraction would completely transform most people’s\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/d0u9zn358qsmu4owr5gtmhzpvrq44clhndgov\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/d0u9zn358qsmu4owr5gtmhzpvrq44clhndgov\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

    "body": "Here’s something that’ll blow your mind about AI Operating.\r\n\r\nMy student Marcus just told me that AI has become his “mega copy\r\ndrive.”\r\n\r\nHe can now produce high-quality VSLs, YouTube scripts, and ad\r\nscripts in minutes instead of hours.\r\n\r\nBefore AI, writing one email for a client would take 30+ minutes.\r\n\r\nNow, he cranks out entire email sequences in the time it used to\r\ntake for one email.\r\n\r\nThis is why AI Operating is exploding right now.\r\n\r\nThe same work that used to take agencies weeks can now be done in\r\nhours, but you’re still charging the same rates (or higher\r\nbecause you’re getting better results).\r\n\r\nYou can write emails in any client’s voice instantly, build\r\nfunnels 10x faster, create sales scripts that actually convert,\r\nand manage entire campaigns with minimal effort.\r\n\r\nWhile everyones afraid of AI, here's what I've realized:\r\n\r\nAI doesn’t replace you, it makes you 10x more valuable.\r\n\r\nBecause now you can deliver $20k+ worth of value to a client\r\nwhile only working 10-15 hours per week.\r\n\r\nYou become the most efficient operator they’ve ever worked with,\r\nwhich makes you irreplaceable.\r\n\r\nThat’s the AI Operating advantage, and it’s why my students are\r\nlanding revenue share deals that pay them like business partners.\r\n\r\nI actually made a whole YouTube video breaking down the smartest\r\nway to capitalize on the AI gold rush.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see exactly how this works before the webinar, go\r\nwatch it here.

Nearly everyone goes through a phase\r\nwhere they’re in a situationship with eight different businesses.\r\n\r\nSomehow you convince yourself that they’re all mid or not “wifey\r\nmaterial.”\r\n\r\nSo you refuse to commit to any one of them and proclaim every\r\nbusiness is a whore!\r\n\r\nThe other day, I met an Uber driver with possibly the worst case\r\nof shiny object syndrome I’d ever seen.\r\n\r\nFirst he told me about his dropshipping business where he sold\r\nDonald Trump t-shirts.\r\n\r\nThen his “tinder for injury lawyers.”\r\n\r\nThen his contracting business.\r\n\r\nThen his AI only fans agency.\r\n\r\nThen he showed me a demo account where he allegedly turned $1k\r\ninto $10m.\r\n\r\nOh, and then he asked me for $100k so he could do it with real\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nI politely declined.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, this guy actually seemed pretty intelligent.\r\n\r\nHe showed me the websites he built for each business and they\r\nwere clean.\r\n\r\nHis ideas were thorough and it’s clear he was doing his research…\r\n\r\nToo much research.\r\n\r\nYou can convince yourself any business is better than what you’re\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nThey all look sexy from afar.\r\n\r\nBut one day, you’ll wake up next to it and see it without makeup.\r\n\r\nAnd only then will you realize it’s been using Facetune and AI\r\nfilters.\r\n\r\nYou’ll find the shortcut once you stop looking for it.\r\n\r\nYou commit. You ignore the temptation.

I thought this was gonna be easy.”\r\n* Valley of despair - “Maybe I’m not cut out for this… Or maybe I\r\njust need to try a different business model. Yes, that’s it! I’m\r\ngonna be an AI Fighter Jet pilot.”\r\n* Informed optimism - “Nah, I’m gonna stick this out. I know\r\nit’ll be difficult but I can do it.”\r\n* Success and fulfillment - “Hello, MTV welcome to my Penthouse.”\r\n\r\nHere’s why I’m telling you this 48 hours before our webinar…\r\n\r\nOne of my Artisan Lab members, Brady, made $250,000 from one\r\nclient in one month.\r\n\r\nYes, you read that right.\r\n\r\nAfter we did his interview, he told me that he almost quit a year\r\nago.\r\n\r\nHe was grinding, but making no money and fell deep into the\r\nvalley of despair.\r\n\r\nAround that time, I made a YouTube video about the emotional\r\ncycle of change.\r\n\r\nHe said that video convinced him to keep pushing…\r\n\r\nFast forward just one year, and he’s hitting six figure months.\r\n\r\nBy signing up for this AI Operating webinar, you’ve already moved\r\ninto stage 4 - informed optimism.\r\n\r\nYou’ve decided to learn the model that’s actually working instead\r\nof jumping to another shiny object.\r\n\r\nDon’t let yourself slip back into the valley of despair now.\r\n\r\nShow up in 48 hours and get the system that can change\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nJuly 23rd at 7pm EST -\r\nhttps://event.webinarjam.com/go/live/3/6rv7mh7fgs2s6 (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403s7u5pqk8ouxh64drl77a5hmzg69/kkhmh6hn3orz58sl/aHR0cHM6Ly9ldmVudC53ZWJpbmFyamFtLmNvbS9nby9saXZlLzMvNnJ2N21oN2ZnczJzNg==\r\n)​\r\n\r\nSee you there,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403s7u5pqk8ouxh64drl77a5hmzg69\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403s7u5pqk8ouxh64drl77a5hmzg69\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

Get off sales calls and transition into something with\r\nmore leverage.\r\n\r\nThat meant he’d take a pay cut.\r\n\r\nAnd if he wanted to even cover living expenses for the next month\r\nhe’d have to go get clients.\r\n\r\nBut as Plato said, “Eh, fuck it.”\r\n\r\nOr maybe it was “Necessity is the mother of invention.”\r\n\r\nThat’s when I taught him the AI Operating model.\r\n\r\nInstead of being stuck on calls all day, he could partner with\r\npersonal brands, handle their entire backend using AI, and get\r\nrevenue shares.\r\n\r\nPhillip’s AI Operating business was born and here’s what happened\r\nnext:\r\n\r\nHe hit $100k in a month with just 3 clients.\r\n\r\n​\r\nSix months ago, he was making $30k/month but working 12+ hours a\r\nday, basically living on Zoom calls like a prisoner.\r\n\r\nNow he makes almost 3x more working half the time and actually\r\nhas a life outside of his laptop.\r\n\r\nAaand the only difference is...\r\n\r\nHe learned the AI Operating model I’m teaching on tomorrow’s\r\nwebinar.\r\n\r\nHe stopped trading time for money and started getting rev shares\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nThis is the power of what I’ll show you tomorrow.\r\n\r\nYou’re not selling your time, you’re selling your systems.\r\n\r\nYou build it once, it runs forever, and you get paid like you own\r\npart of the business.\r\n\r\nWebinar Details:​\r\n📅 Tomorrow (July 23rd) at 7pm EST\r\n🔗 https://event.webinarjam.com/go/live/3/6rv7mh7fgs2s6 (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403s7u5pqk4osxh64drl77a5hmzg69/3ohphkh3n8o7eoar/aHR0cHM6Ly9ldmVudC53ZWJpbmFyamFtLmNvbS9nby9saXZlLzMvNnJ2N21oN2ZnczJzNg==\r\n)​\r\n⏰ 90 minutes + Q&A\r\n\r\nDon’t miss it,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

You barely touched your webinar discount + bonuses. ​\n\n It’s been three days now…\n\n This is usually the part where I start pulling on your heart strings.\n\n I’ve written so many emails like this for my clients that it’s second nature now.\n\n First I would reward you for taking the initial action (coming to the webinar).\n\n Then I would bridge to the problem…\n\n “95% of people will do nothing with the information I showed you the other night.” \n\n And I’d dig that pain a bit so you feel it…\n\n Here’s a direct quote I write in all post webinar sequences for my clients:\n\n “Your life will become a perpetual cycle of \"almost.\" \n\n You'll almost start a business. \n\n You'll almost approach the pretty girl. \n\n You'll almost become the person you know you can be. \n\n But you won't. \n\n You'll be stuck watching videos about how to make money, how to improve your relationships, and how to stop your lingering anxiety... \n\n Because knowledge means NOTHING without the appropriate action.” \n\n Did that make you feel any pressure?\n\n If so, go here and apply to join me inside Artisan Lab. ​\n\n If not, keep reading.\n\n You’re a skeptic.\n\n Maybe you want to try it on your own.\n\n Maybe you still don’t believe me – despite the fact that I showed you countless examples of people running it the fuck up.\n\n Or maybe you’re just funnel hacking and stealing my copy.\n\n Either way, I’ll skip the emotional build up and just give you the facts:\n\n 9 members of Artisan Lab have hit $100k months.\n\n Over two dozen have reached $20k/mo+.\n\n The online education industry is growing at over 10% per year and it’s projected to reach $280B by 2029.\n\n You can sit on the sideline and complain.\n\n Or you can get in the game and capitalize.\n\n That’s a choice only you can make.\n\n So if you want my help…\n\n Plus a $1k discount, a free 1-1 with me, and guest lessons from some of the biggest names in the info-product space…\n\n ​ Go here now. ​\n\n Talk soon,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. If you're like me and you hate calls -- or you have questions you want answered before booking, just reply to this email and lmk.\n\n I'll personally hit you back (as long as you don't ask me for a 90% discount).\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

    "body": "I’m in downtown Chicago, sitting in a coffee shop that doubles as\r\na bar.\r\n\r\nIt looks exactly how you’d imagine.\r\n\r\nDark walls, wooden tables, and barstools that look easy to pick\r\nup and swing at someone’s head.\r\n\r\nThey’re playing Mr. Blue Sky on the speaker. Forgotten banger.\r\n\r\nIt took me 22 minutes to get here, although it’s only a 3 minute\r\nwalk from my hotel.\r\n\r\nI asked the receptionist “What’s the best coffee shop around\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“Jründgen ven” she said.\r\n\r\nShe had a German(?) accent that seemed to only be thick when\r\npronouncing the name of the cafe.\r\n\r\nI mostly understood the rest of her directions but wasn’t really\r\npaying attention because I was trying to make out what Jrüdgen\r\nven was.\r\n\r\nShe said something about going to the left and taking an\r\nelevator.

You’re down 17 with a\r\nminute 24 on the clock!” you yell, somehow not knowing they can’t\r\nhear you.\r\n\r\nAnd then, with 19 seconds left in the game, it happens.\r\n\r\nThe quarterback throws the ball across the middle to number 81\r\nfor 7 yards.\r\n\r\nIt’s a meaningless play, the clock runs out, and the Texans lose.\r\n\r\nBut it meant everything to you.\r\n\r\nThat single catch means you’re not only back to breakeven, but\r\nyou’re in the green!\r\n\r\nOne event made up for all of your losses.\r\n\r\nBusiness is the same way — especially in the beginning.\r\n\r\nMost days it’s just pain.\r\n\r\nOne loss after another, your hard work is unrewarded, you want to\r\nquit…\r\n\r\nBut then…\r\n\r\nAfter 3 months of sending outbound messages with no luck, you get\r\na banger client.\r\n\r\nAfter posting 150 videos that flop, you go viral and it explodes\r\nyour business.\r\n\r\nAfter approaching 7,321 women in the street, one finally doesn’t\r\nrun away.\r\n\r\nYou need to adopt the mindset of the addicted gambler.\r\n\r\nThey will not stop.\r\n\r\nThe hole will get deeper and deeper…\r\n\r\nUntil one day…\r\n\r\n​One win makes up for everything.

You’re down 17 with a minute 24 on the clock!” you yell, somehow not knowing they can’t hear you.\n\n And then, with 19 seconds left in the game, it happens.\n\n The quarterback throws the ball across the middle to number 81 for 7 yards.\n\n It’s a meaningless play, the clock runs out, and the Texans lose.\n\n But it meant everything to you.\n\n That single catch means you’re not only back to breakeven, but you’re in the green!\n\n One event made up for all of your losses.\n\n Business is the same way — especially in the beginning.\n\n Most days it’s just pain.\n\n One loss after another, your hard work is unrewarded, you want to quit…\n\n But then…\n\n After 3 months of sending outbound messages with no luck, you get a banger client.\n\n After posting 150 videos that flop, you go viral and it explodes your business.\n\n After approaching 7,321 women in the street, one finally doesn’t run away.\n\n You need to adopt the mindset of the addicted gambler.\n\n They will not stop.\n\n The hole will get deeper and deeper…\n\n Until one day…\n\n ​ One win makes up for everything. ​\n\n TOUCHDOWN!\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. This is not an endorsement of sports betting. If you’re gonna gamble, only do so with a sum you’re comfortable losing.\n\n P.P.S. Justin Jefferson any time TD, Caleb Williams O 218.5 passing yards, Rome Odunze any time TD (not financial advice).\n\n ​\n​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n​\n​\n​",

Yours aren’t.\n\n See you in a Ferrari with a supermodel in your passenger seat.\n\n To the stubborn and unreasonable – I will help you win. ​\n\n Nature loves courage,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. I’d feel slightly irresponsible by not clarifying some nuance here.\n\n Not compromising doesn’t mean you refuse to turn up the temperature when you set it at 67 and your girl wants it at 72.\n\n It also doesn’t mean that there is only one way to accomplish a goal and the route can’t be adjusted.\n\n But when it comes to the real shit you want…\n\n Don’t let anyone talk you out of it (including yourself).\n\n ​ This is for those who refuse to compromise. ​\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

New York is 1-4.\r\n\r\nThe New York Giants haven't won a Thursday night football game in\r\nTEN years…\r\n\r\nUntil last night.\r\n\r\nNot only did they win…\r\n\r\nBut they won by 17 points.\r\n\r\nSeven. Teen.\r\n\r\nAnd once again, I lost money.\r\n\r\nSports betting and business are similar in some ways.\r\n\r\nYou risk your dollars to hopefully get more dollars in return.\r\n\r\nIf you can predictably turn just $1 into $2 at scale, you’ll soon\r\nbe rich.\r\n\r\nMy goal with the people who invest into Artisan Lab is to do\r\nexactly that.\r\n\r\nThey give me their hard-earned money and I help them turn it into\r\nmuch more.\r\n\r\nApparently it’s working a little too well…\r\n\r\nI got this message from Lorenzo the other day:\r\n\r\n​\r\nHe paid me and then told me I undercharged him.\r\n\r\nAnd that was before a recent addition:\r\n\r\nSanjay, who manages roughly $1M/month in ad spend, just joined as\r\nour newest coach.\r\n\r\nWe now have coaching calls every weekday…\r\n\r\nAnd by next week, Sanjay will have finished a brand-new paid ads\r\ncourse that’s being added to the program.\r\n\r\nSo, a week from today -- October 17th at 11:59PM EST -- the price\r\nis officially going up.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been waiting for a sign, this is it.

New York is 1-4.\n\n The New York Giants haven't won a Thursday night football game in TEN years…\n\n Until last night.\n\n Not only did they win…\n\n But they won by 17 points. \n\n Seven. Teen.\n\n And once again, I lost money.\n\n Sports betting and business are similar in some ways.\n\n You risk your dollars to hopefully get more dollars in return.\n\n If you can predictably turn just $1 into $2 at scale, you’ll soon be rich.\n\n My goal with the people who invest into Artisan Lab is to do exactly that.\n\n They give me their hard-earned money and I help them turn it into much more.\n\n Apparently it’s working a little too well…\n\n I got this message from Lorenzo the other day:\n\n ​ He paid me and then told me I undercharged him.\n\n And that was before a recent addition:\n\n Sanjay, who manages roughly $1M/month in ad spend, just joined as our newest coach.\n\n We now have coaching calls every weekday…\n\n And by next week, Sanjay will have finished a brand-new paid ads course that’s being added to the program.\n\n So, a week from today -- October 17th at 11:59PM EST -- the price is officially going up.\n\n If you’ve been waiting for a sign, this is it. ​\n\n Here's your chance to go back in time and bet on the Giants money-line last night…\n\n Where $1 would’ve turned into $3.40.\n\n ​ Apply for Artisan Lab here. ​\n\n Ben\n\n P.S.

    "body": "I cold plunged yesterday.\r\n\r\nIt was my first time in a while.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, cold plunging was my entire personality – for\r\nabout two weeks.\r\n\r\nI’d scoff at people who’d never endured the piercing feeling of\r\nsubmerging their body in 45-degree water.\r\n\r\n“What a normie, skinny fat, soy-boy loser,” I thought.\r\n\r\nBut for the past couple years, I’ve rarely done it.\r\n\r\nUntil yesterday.\r\n\r\nAnd ironically this time, I was the normie, skinny fat, soy-boy\r\nloser.\r\n\r\nI was at this spa with a cold plunge right next to a hot tub.\r\n\r\nI figured I’d start off with a few minutes in the cold, then move\r\nto the heat.\r\n\r\nFour seconds later I was running out of the water.\r\n\r\nI imagine this is how they felt on the Titanic – except my\r\nexperience was worse.\r\n\r\nTime for a new strategy.\r\n\r\nI got in the hot tub for a few minutes, then went back to the\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nThis time, it worked. I lasted about 5x longer.\r\n\r\nThe only problem was 4 multiplied by 5 is still only 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis pissed me off.\r\n\r\nI used to sit in that damn tub for 10-15 minutes without\r\nflinching.\r\n\r\nSo for the next half hour, I went back and forth between the two.\r\n\r\nI could only last about a minute in the cold.\r\n\r\nEach time, I thought I’d be fine once the first 30-second shock\r\nwore off\r\n\r\nEach time, I was wrong.\r\n\r\nAlright, one more attempt…\r\n\r\nI submerged into the frigid water telling myself:\r\n\r\n“You’ve done this before.”\r\n\r\n“The pain will subside, just breathe.”\r\n\r\n“If you get out you’re gay.”\r\n\r\nThat last one really got me.\r\n\r\nA minute in, I’m fine.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes in, still chillin.\r\n\r\nThree minutes in, it feels like a hot tub.\r\n\r\nI stayed in that bitch ass water for the next five minutes.\r\n\r\nNow, I know you’re thinking, “wowwww Ben you’re so fucking sick\r\ndude!”\r\n\r\nThank you, b.\r\n\r\nHere’s the real reason I’ve told you this silly little story:\r\n\r\nI only accomplished the goal because I knew I could.\r\n\r\nI’d done it before – meaning I had previous data indicating it\r\nwas possible.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I was so stubborn.\r\n\r\nI didn’t want to fail at something that I knew I could do.\r\n\r\nSo my question for you is:\r\n\r\nIf you knew that you couldn’t fail, would you ever quit?\r\n\r\nProbably not, right?\r\n\r\nYour success is guaranteed.\r\n\r\nIt might take three months.\r\n\r\nIt might take a year.\r\n\r\nIt might take five years.\r\n\r\nBut if you just keep getting back in that cold ass water…\r\n\r\nEventually it’ll feel normal.\r\n\r\nPeople just like you have done it – it’s your turn.
