    "body": "This is awkward. Not too long ago, I set out on this journey of sending an email every day for 100 days.\n\n Aaaand I haven't sent an email in 6 days.\n\n If I had a good excuse, I'd insert it [here].\n\n But I don't.\n\n Let's pretend like that didn't happen and carry on with day 10, okay?\n\n Okay.\n\n If you ever want to lose faith in humanity, get an apartment overlooking a busy road. I've witnessed 3 near accidents while pondering where I will take this email.\n\n My brain is fried from scrolling through tik tok all day. And writing for all of these different offers has confused me.\n\n I'm so adept at putting myself in a client's shoes and writing to their audience that I've lost touch with my voice.\n\n I've joked about this before, but I might be starting to develop schizophrenia.\n\n There are so many things I want to write abou– YOU NEED TO MAKE MONEY ONLINE, OR YOUR FAMILY HATES YOU, AND YOU'RE A WORTHLESS PIECE OF SCUM.\n\n Sorry, that was an alternate personality coming out. I didn't mean it.\n\n I wish no one actually read this thing. Because then I could share what I want without putting on a front.\n\n But I can't see who's on the other side of the screen. What if it's a potential client? Or someone who looks up to me? An acquaintance? A friend? A family member? (It's not a family member; I manually unsubscribed all of them).\n\n What if my reality doesn't live up to your inflated perception of me?\n\n Or maybe it's not inflated? Maybe you think I'm just some idiot kid, sporadically typing illegible sentences to you through the world wide web…\n\n This was supposed to be a safe space. One where I earn your trust by sharing the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\n I want to write like nobody's reading… maybe I'll keep this one in the archive forever.\n\n I'll write another email about how I generated a few hundred grand for my clients this week.\n\n That'll keep the readers happy. How cool, right? I'll tell them about the webinar and how amazing the Black Friday sale went…\n\n That's the email I'll share… definitely not this one. \n\n So now that it's just you and me, I'm glad we can talk.\n\n Because on the outside, you may see this 22-year-old kid who's got it figured out. He lives in Miami, has dope friends, makes money, travels, and builds cool shit (and he's insanely fucking handsome).\n\n But sometimes, on the inside, he feels like everything is crumbling…like he's faking it all…He thinks others are passing him, he'll never figure it out, and he bit off more than he can chew.\n\n Maybe that's why he hasn't sent an email in 6 days – Because he doesn't want them to know what he wants to say.\n\n Whenever he opens his laptop, he stares at a blinking cursor on a blank screen. He knows what he wants to write when he puts his fingers on the keyboard. But those thoughts vanish to protect this illusion he portrays.\n\n Now, this is all hypothetical, of course. I don't want you to think I'M saying any of these things. \n\n My life is actually perfect. And this journal entry will never actually see the light of day anyway.\n\n So I guess I'll start to wrap this up. Because I've got to write the email that I'm actually going to send today.\n\n I'm glad we had this chat, though - just the two of us.\n\n Just keep doing what you're doing, bro. You're on the right path… And you know no one really knows what they're doing? They're all just faking it too.\n\n Think about how far you've come. In another world, you're about to start looking for a $70k-a-year job out of college.\n\n Be grateful for where you are.\n\n Good talk.",

Let's get into it, {{ subscriber.first_name }}!\n\n When I first got into online biz, I had this idealistic belief that my time would be spent traveling and meeting cool new friends.\n\n I quickly learned a lot of nights (especially in the beginning) are spent alone.\n\n But now I have a network of absolute G’s that make this whole entrepreneurship thing 10x better.\n\n I’ve built these relationships through various communities online, Twitter being the main platform.\n\n The people I used to watch from a far are now some of my closest friends.\n\n And if you don’t know, mi amigo Harry and I started a podcast a few months ago called Internet Kids.\n\n The sole purpose was to have interesting conversations and connect with more people in the online biz world.\n\n We did just that and people loved it, so we pondered the idea of making clothing and turning it into a brand.\n\n But unless you’ve been living under a rock or are blind and deaf, you’ve heard about everything that’s going on with Web 3.\n\n Getting deeper into this space allowed us the creativity to build something that encompasses all that the Internet Kids brand really stands for.\n\n We want to create an environment that will allow people to connect with others and build this idealistic lifestyle that many of us have when they get into online business.\n\n The Internet Kids NFTs will give you access to exclusive clothing, private events (first one in Miami Q1 2022), interactive games that allow you to win SOL, and white girls with parental issues.\n\n This community will be truly special and I’d love to see your handsome (or pretty) face inside.\n\n ​ Join my cult here. ​\n\n ​ Now! ​\n\n ​ NOWWW!!!!! ​\n\n See you in Miami ;)\n\n - Ben",

    "body": "“Any task completed repeatedly for an extended period becomes effortless.”\n\n Someone smart said that before.\n\n It was probably more articulate than I just stated, but the same point nonetheless.\n\n It’s simple.\n\n Do something for a long time, and you’ll get good at it.\n\n I remember my 11-year-old self watching with pure amusement as the man behind the counter perfectly spun the pizza on his finger. I thought to myself, “damn, I don’t think I’d ever be able to do that.”\n\n Now at age 22, I still can’t spin a pizza on my finger like my long-lost friend Mario.\n\n But I guarantee you that if I spent these last 11 years honing my pizza-spinning skills, I’d be whipping dough around my fingers like nobody’s business.\n\n I don’t actually remember his name but Mario just sounds right.\n\n Anyway, back to the point.\n\n I’m talking about this Kaizen principal because today marks day one of a long journey.\n\n One hundred days in a row of long-form writing.\n\n Why?\n\n Good question. I’m not sure what I’m gonna do with this or where I’ll share it. But if you’re reading this, I guess I figured it out.\n\n So I guess a hello is appropriate.\n\n I’m Ben.\n\n Right now, I’m sitting in my overpriced-but-somehow-worth-every-penny Herman Miller Aeron chair.\n\n It’s a quiet Thursday night here in my Miami skybox.\n\n My across-the-sky neighbor is on the couch in his living room playing call of duty again. It’s become a nightly ritual for us.\n\n I’ll watch him turn on COD around 8:33 pm and consequently wonder if anyone is watching me and writing about it on the internet.\n\n He just got a kill.\n\n I’m also toggling back and forth between this page and the Thursday night football game.\n\n I bet on the Falcons, and their deficit seems to increase every time I check. Down 13-0 at the moment.\n\n I just remembered what I wanted to talk to you about today. This idea came to me in the shower a few hours ago while I was thinking about one of the happiest periods of my life.\n\n It was around February to May 2021. I’d finally started making money online. Those first $3k, $5k, and $10k months were unforgettable.\n\n I was on top of the world. After all this time, I finally proved I could do it.\n\n But when I think back to those times, most of the highlights aren’t sexy.\n\n They’re the little moments of gratitude. Or the normally mundane mornings that I’ve colored with a nostalgic hue.\n\n I remember walking on the stair stepper at my college gym, wearing a ripped blue t-shirt, smiling like an idiot while typing away Tweets on the keyboard.\n\n It was my first $6k month, and I was rich. Not literally, but I would’ve been if wealth were measured in gratitude.\n\n There’s a collection of other minuscule moments I won’t bore you with a story behind, but this idea in and of itself is interesting.\n\n You probably have this grand vision for where you’d like to be in 6 months, a year, five years… but the scenes you imagine now probably won’t be what you appreciate when you get there.\n\n You’ll have fond memories of the beautiful blonde in the passenger seat of your Porsche 911, but the one that stands out isn’t picture-perfect.\n\n It’s the late-night fast food run where she spills her frosty on the seat, and you rip the t-shirt off your back to wipe it off before it seeps into the leather.\n\n It’s when you drop your potatoes and run out of the grocery store to your desk because you just had an idea that must be acted upon immediately.\n\n I don’t know if any of this made sense, but if you’re still reading this far along we’re probably on the same page (figuratively).\n\n It looks like my Call Of Duty-loving neighbor just called it a night and that’s my sign to do the same.\n\n Day 1 is down; 99 more to go.\n\n We’ll chat tomorrow if I don’t forget.\n\n - Ben",

I guess these are my Boron letters.\n\n Unless you write copy for a living, you probably don't get that reference, but it's okay. You don't need to.\n\n Today is 11/11/22. Apparently, it's a lucky day.\n\n After putting my net worth on black at the online roulette table, I beg to differ.\n\n Kidding.\n\n Speaking of great ways to waste money, I dropped out of college in January 2021. \n\n Twenty-two months later, my life looks a lot different.\n\n I've made a few hundred grand and generated a lot more for my clients by clicking buttons on the internet.\n\n Now I'm living in Miami with a circle of brothers that make me feel poor.\n\n One principle I can think of has been pivotal in my success.\n\n I'm trying not to sound like one of those dorks from Twitter who tells you to drink water and stop jerking your chicken.\n\n Hear me out.\n\n Delusional self-belief is the best trait you can adopt.\n\n You truly are the person you believe you are. Nearly everything can be trained and improved.\n\n If you don't like the person you see when you look at yourself in the mirror, you have all the power to do something about it.\n\n Having an unwavering sense of self will give you the confidence to take more risks. To burn the boats. And to be resilient.\n\n If there's one thing you do from reading this email, let it be this:\n\n Take out a piece of paper and describe in detail the person you want to be.\n\n What does he or she look like? What are their habits? How would their friends describe them?\n\n List out their character traits, the type of clothes they wear, and so on. This can be the \"you\" six months or six years from now. There's no right or wrong way to do this as long as you're detailed.\n\n Once that person is established, it's time to take the baton.\n\n Carry yourself the way that ideal version carries themself. Talk the way they talk. Think the way they think.\n\n Understand that nothing happens in the future. If you want to change, that change must happen NOW; this is how you do it.\n\n This is how you change your life.\n\n Aren't you glad you subscribed to this instead of some random girls only fans?\n\n Listen.\n\n This is how you reinvent yourself.\n\n It sounds corny, and it kind of is.\n\n But I went from basketball player to frat star, to idiot business owner, to less idiot business owner. And it's all because I chose the person I wanted to be and assumed that identity.\n\n Your reality is a conscious decision.\n\n You decide to put yourself in a box.\n\n You decide to let circumstances affect you.\n\n And you decide the lifestyle you live.\n\n Unsubscribe from the beliefs that no longer serve you.\n\n And unsubscribe from your exes only fans.\n\n ​\n\n Talk tomorrow,\n\n Ben\n\n ​",

My across-the-sky neighbor is enjoying the show with his girl.\n\n It’s not the COD-playing neighbor I wrote about in 001. I don’t think he has many friends. The dude on the floor above him is my homie, Clarence.\n\n We’ve never spoken, but he looks like his name is Clarence.\n\n We wave to each other while drinking morning coffee on our parallel balconies.\n\n I think he’s in ecom because he works on his laptop and I saw him taking product pics one time.\n\n Anyway, I wish you guys could see the view right now.\n\n I’d take a picture for you, but “some moments are best kept as memories.”\n\n A girl told me that while we were drinking wine on the beach looking up at the stars.\n\n I’m not sure if it was profound or if I just wanted to smash. She had pretty eyes.\n\n It’s a Saturday night and I’m leaning toward staying in.\n\n Many of my favorite nights are spent at my laptop with a ninety-dollar Diptyque candle on my desk. I’m either planning a road to $100 mil or gambling away my life savings at the roulette table. Never an in-between.\n\n Life’s too short to half-ass anything. But most people half-ass the entire thing.\n\n It’s easy to do when you were raised like me. Good family and never had to stress about food on the table, or bills being paid.\n\n Sounds like a pretty good upbringing, no?\n\n It is, but often times it leads to a mediocre life.\n\n Everything is too convenient. It’s easy to get a decent job and climb the corporate ladder.\n\n Why push for more?\n\n Just play it safe and you’ll never have to struggle.\n\n Easy times create weak men and weak men cut off their balls and dye their hair pink… or however the saying goes.\n\n To me, the most miserable existence of all is one where you never push all your chips to the middle.\n\n You never get to find out what you’re capable of when your back is against the wall.\n\n I’d rather lose everything than never try.\n\n You test yourself as a man. And like a sword, you come through the fire sharper than you were before.\n\n Run towards the things that scare you. The more resistance you feel, the more it means you need to do it.\n\n Unless you’re scared of fat bitches because I am too and I’m RUNNING away like the wind.\n\n I got stuck walking behind one today for 22.4 seconds. The longest 22.4 seconds of my life.\n\n This email just took a turn and if I keep going down this route I might end up in handcuffs.\n\n I’ll leave you with a quote from a movie that changed my life, Fight Club. eye-roll \n\n “I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who’ve ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s**t we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War’s a spiritual war… our Great Depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.”\n\n Thanks for reading today’s scatterbrained rant.\n\n Chat tomorrow fellow space monkey,\n\n Ben",

I have a science test second period.\" I'd frantically remember.\n\n It was one of those classes where I couldn't even tell you what the test was about. \n\n I was just hoping that the Asian girl to my right would write big enough so I could copy her again.

She does it out of love, and you take care of her.\n\n I wonder if this is how Zuckerberg felt when he got the idea for Facebook.\n\n Anyway, I sat in the sun for a while today, and it made me sleepy.\n\n Half of my body was in the shade, and now I look like the dude from Batman when he gets his face burned off.\n\n I'm gonna go to bed and hope that when I wake up tomorrow, it somehow evens out.\n\n Have a great week,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S.

I was in a Honda Civic. He was in a yellow Ferrari Pista. Safe to say I didn't win.\n\n Ok, back to the story.\n\n A lot of the book is just motivation porn, but for a 13-year-old with big dreams, it was my bible.\n\n In retrospect, one of the book's last lines made a lasting impact on me.\n\n \"Every dream you imagine, everything you see and hear and feel in your sleep, that's not a fantasy, that's your deep instinct telling you it can be all real. Follow those visions and dreams and desires and believe what you know. Only you can turn those dreams into reality. Never stop until you do.\"\n\n Gives me the chills to this day.\n\n When you ask a 9-year-old kid what they want to be when they grow up, they don't say investment banker. They don't say accountant. They don't say waiter. They don't say only fans model.\n\n But 12 years later, whatever goals they had have been beaten out of them.\n\n Makes me sad just talking about it, so I'm changing the topic.\n\n Today I learned that one of my (formerly) favorite gurus is kind of a scammer.\n\n Not a full scammer… he didn't hire an army of college kids to hand out fake parking tickets, set up a \"website\" where people go to pay, steal their card info and sell it on the black market.\n\n I had that idea after I got a parking ticket once. It's genius.\n\n Anyway, I watched this guy's Youtube videos in college and took a full 2-3 pages worth of notes on each video.\n\n I planned on going to his live events and maybe investing in his coaching one day.\n\n And today, I found out he sucks at his job.\n\n Want me to tell you who?\n\n You're probably on the edge of your seat right now.\n\n Let me tell you how I learned this. \n\n I was talking to a guy today who has over 450k followers on tik tok. He's in the dating niche, his content is good, and anyone in that position should be able to make AT LEAST $20k a month.\n\n Like bare minimum. Seriously.\n\n He's working with [redacted], who told him to make an 8-week coaching program and sell it entirely through the DM's. No sales calls.\n\n The course is only $300 and this poor guy is lucky when he gets more than 2 sales a month.\n\n Here's the worst part…\n\n [redacted] is charging him $2,500 a month for CONSULTING.\n\n The anonymous brain-dead monkey accounts on Twitter could help this guy more than [redacted] is.\n\n U N R E A L\n\n If you're still reading, reply with a guess of who you think the guru is, and I'll tell you if you're right or wrong.\n\n My eyes are getting tired and you're probably tired of reading the word [redacted] so I think we should end this.\n\n I have to sneeze.\n\n Much love,\n\n Ben\n\n ​",

    "body": "It’s 9:55 pm here in Brickell, and it’s one of those days where it’s a struggle to even get a sentence out on here.\n\n I legit had to rewrite that first line 8 times.\n\n This would be much easier in person because of days like this. I could just ask you a question and nod my head as if I’m listening.\n\n In college, I got pretty good at appearing interested in what people are saying without actually listening.\n\n After all, it’d make anyone go crazy listening to 26 variations of the same blonde girl explaining crystals and star signs.\n\n “Yes Jessica, I get it. When Sagittarius rises, the sun goes into retrosynthesis.”\n\n Imagine getting that same lecture every day.\n\n I had to tune it out for my own sanity.\n\n Over the past few days, I’ve started to notice how everything in my life is connected.\n\n When I’m consistent in the gym, I get more work done. When I write to you people, sad voice goes away.\n\n Action = Happy Ben.\n\n I’m envious of people that are able to have a horrible routine and still be incredibly productive.\n\n One of my friends embodies this to its core. I don’t want to name names, so we’ll call him “Eagle Jason.”\n\n Jason wakes up whenever he wants and scrolls on tik tok for an hour while puffing on his 4 pink puff-berry vapes.\n\n He rolls out of bed to go downstairs and get the venti skinny vanilla latte he just ordered on uber eats.\n\n Then he gets out his laptop and refreshes stripe. He’s already made more money today than most people will all month.\n\n Cardin– I mean, Eagle Jason is your anti-guru. The kid can do everything “wrong” and still operate at a level that most people can’t reach without a copious amount of stimulants.\n\n I learned 2 new things today.\n\n The word “vapious.” The geographical layout of America. I realized I had very little understanding of which state was which, so I started taking this online quiz.\n\n It gives you the name of a state, and you click the according location on the map.\n\n This little “ding” would sound when you got the answer correct, and that sound quickly became addicting.\n\n 2 hours later, I got 50/50 and started timing myself on how quickly I could complete it.\n\n I knew my friend Mason (crazy how close his name is to Jason, lol) would appreciate this tedious little game.\n\n So, I sent him the link, and about an hour later, we were racing each other to see who could complete the map quicker.\n\n This consumed my entire afternoon.\n\n My high score was 1 minute 24 seconds, and Mason’s was 1 minute 11 seconds. Kids got fucking speed.\n\n ​ Here’s the link if you’re also an autistic monkey that’s entertained by the simplest things.\n\n Listen to the song “Fortunate Son” by CCR for added effect.\n\n God bless America,\n\n Ben",

Apparently, the latter means “to reveal”\n\n It’s 10:36 pm, and I spent the last 22 minutes watching a Corvette C8 review on Youtube.\n\n My dopamine receptors get really fucked up every Wednesday because I watch my friend/client make an absurd amount of money in about an hour and a half on our weekly webinar.\n\n After the high of seeing the money come in so quickly, there’s this looming sense of emptiness afterward.\n\n Money is interesting.\n\n It’s not going to solve all of your problems.\n\n But it’s a problem that needs to be solved.\n\n And as you solve the money problem, your other problems will be solved.\n\n I know it sounds like I’m a homeless man babbling riddles to his imaginary best friend, so let me explain.\n\n In most cases, you have to become a very capable person to make a lot of money.\n\n A person that’s capable of critical thinking, showing poise under pressure, leading a team, etc.\n\n The type of person with the qualities I mentioned above is disciplined and rational, but valiant.\n\n See where this is going yet?\n\n Many qualities people lack before making money are earned in the process of making money.\n\n I don’t know if this is high-level insight or if I’m just really tired, so it sounds good, but I’m going to keep running with it.\n\n This is why the crypto dorks or lottery winners will end up doing some dumb shit and lose their money.\n\n I might’ve made this analogy a few emails ago, but it applies here, too, so forgive me:\n\n When you heat a sword in fire, it becomes malleable. Then you beat it with a hammer over and over, and eventually, its impurities are gone… Creating a much sharper than it was before.\n\n The moral of the story - burn lottery winners and crypto dorks and beat them with hammers.\n\n I’m tired.\n\n Goodnight.\n\n ( I know it’s not nighttime when you receive this email, so good morning or good afternoon too)\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

I had to write 4 emails, an entire sales page, and send a cold DM.\n\n After all that, I was left with only 3 or 4 hours to spare.\n\n You might be thinking, “isn’t that enough time to write a 400-word email?”\n\n Great question. And yes, it is.\n\n BUT here’s what happened. I decided to put a small $300 live bet on the Miami Heat to beat the Washington Wizards.\n\n After that didn’t hit, I went to the virtual roulette table to recoup my “investment,” where I found myself in a $1,500 hole.\n\n Now, if there’s one thing you know about me, it’s that I’m not a quitter. \n\n I dug myself all the way out of that hole and only ended down $400 on the day.\n\n As a celebration, I smoked a joint for the first time in a few months, and there was zero chance I was sitting down to write a coherent sentence after that.\n\n We’re back today, so thanks for your patience.\n\n It’s interesting how everyone has a story that they tell the world and another story that’s the real truth.\n\n I decided to commit to 100 days of writing long-form emails because I wanted to become a better writer…\n\n Kinda. That’s what I’ll tell you if you ask.\n\n But truly, I’m doing this for a few reasons.\n\n The first is discipline. If I can’t commit to sitting at my desk for 30 minutes a day and hitting random letters on my keyboard, I have bigger problems.\n\n The final reason (and the actual one behind the two cover-ups I just gave you) is to use this as an outlet to vent.\n\n If I go a while without pausing to check in with myself, I start to go crazy.\n\n My goal here is to break down the wall between who I present myself as to the world and what really goes on inside my head.\n\n But even now, I’m debating saying what I know is true vs what I want you to think.\n\n This is quite vague and scattered, and I assume I’ve lost most of you, so if you’re still with me I hope this made some sense.\n\n Talk tomorrow,\n\n Ben",

    "body": "Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},\n\n It’s been a super productive morning. I’ve gotten almost everything on my to-do list done already, and it’s only 10:15 am.\n\n Who knew how much you could accomplish when you just sit down and work?\n\n I’d been meditating naked while praying to my David Goggins poster for the last 2 years, thinking THAT would make me a millionaire.\n\n Oh well, better later than never.\n\n Wait, why are you looking at me like I impregnated your Grandma?\n\n Do I have something on my fa– OHHH, you’re mad that I haven’t emailed you in months after telling you that I was gonna email you for 100 days straight.\n\n Aaaand to make it worse, I’m carrying on like nothing ever happened. Talk about an elephant in the room.\n\n This is probably how girlfriends feel when you do something they don’t like, but they don’t wanna tell you what it was.\n\n You know somethings wrong, and you keep asking her, “bb, what’s wrong” and she says, “nothinngggg” but the tone gets angrier every time you ask.\n\n And then, FINALLY she cracks and tells you what’s pissing her off.\n\n Turns out she’s mad that you got her whole milk instead of oat milk in her iced latte… Yup, been there too man.\n\n Ok, sorry I'm deflecting.\n\n You see, what really happened is I’ve accidentally been sending to the wrong segment. So we’re actually on day 74 of the 100-day email challenge, and you just haven’t been getting the emails! Haha!\n\n Ok, you’re right that’s BS. Stop looking at me like that… FINE! I committed to writing an email every day for 100 days, and I quit on day 9. I said it. Happy now?\n\n A lot has changed since we last spoke.\n\n First and most importantly, I got a Nespresso machine. I’m actually sitting on my balcony with a burnt tongue, still managing to sip down this latte.\n\n Second, I bought a toy.\n\n It’s black and german (pause).\n\n Yes, I’m talking about an Audi RS5. And don’t forget the R or the S. Because that means racing sport. And it signifies that I’m better than all the other wagie cucks that drive around in A5s or S5s.\n\n I didn’t really post it on Twitter (like everyone else when they get their first nice car) because I wanted to feel like I was better than everyone.\n\n It sounds cooler to buy it and keep it private, right? Like, oh, not a big deal at all that I spent more money on a hunk of metal than what I would’ve made annually with a job out of college.\n\n Not that that’s super impressive… I imagine most Communications majors from the College of Charleston end up dying their hair pink and making frappuccinos' for a living.\n\n I’m buying another toy today too, actually. It’s a lot smaller and about 1/5th the price.\n\n I’ll show you tomorrow on the rare chance that I actually send another email this quarter.\n\n Anyone wanna take a side bet? Live odds for me sending an email tomorrow are about +800.\n\n But hey, if you read all the way to here, hit reply and let me know. I thrive off validation from strangers behind a screen, and if enough of you [redacted] reply, maybe I’ll keep this train going.\n\n GREAT catching up with you {{ subscriber.first_name }}.\n\n Talk tomorrow for +800 :)\n\n Ben\n​",

But because I want your money.\n\n All of these people that you see online are making a FUCK TON of money, and I’m only getting % of it.\n\n I want the whole pie.\n\n So I decided that I’m gonna start taking this newsletter more seriously and sell you some bullshit Dan Koe/ Dickie Bush style writing course.\n\n Not to hate on either of them because they’re both great. And they’re really good at organizing notions.\n\n Anyway, I worked with a guy recently who had a really hot assistant. It was clear she was only on the team because she was hot, but boy was that a great idea.\n\n When you’re in the presence of an attractive female, everyone brings their A-Game. And it’s completely sub-conscious.\n\n And just imagine being a client trying to fire me, and some bimbo barbie gets on the call and says, “noooo don’t go, John. I know we spent $104,000 last month and we only made you $2,400 back, but think about all the fun we’ve had. We’re meant to be.”\n\n The original “client retention hack.” Not that any of your favorite Twitter dorks keep clients for longer than a few months anyway.\n\n Oh yeah, back to my writing course.\n\n I think the first module will be able how to write concisely, and never get sidetracked. Because CLEARLY, I’m very good at that.\n\n Also Mason, if you’re reading this, don’t worry. It’s not gonna compete with Copy MBA (it’s gonna be way better).\n\n But you, {{ subscriber.first_name }}, should go click that link and buy it because I get a %.\n\n Didn’t think this email would turn into a promo for one of my friends' courses, but here we are.\n\n On that note, time for me to ask chat GPT to tuck me in and read me a bedtime story because I’m calling it a night.\n\n Live odds I email you tomorrow are +1100. Reply to put in your bet.\n\n Night,\n\n Ben",

Remember when you were chasing what you have right now?\n\n But now it just feels so normal… there was no mystical point of arrival.\n\n Before I turn this into some corny “be grateful” type email, the couple next to me got like 4 different entrees, and shorty just got up to order more.\n\n Breakfast is a scam. Anyone that claims to be hungry before noon literally just has no self-control. They’re just bored and would rather get up and waddle to the local woofery rather than do anything productive with their lives.\n\n If you’re reading this while taking a bite of your warm little pancake breakfast at 11 am, spit it out.

Pleasure to have you.\n\n I’ll fill you in real quick.\n\n On November 10th, 2022, I set out to write a daily email to my subscribers for 100 days straight.\n\n Today marks day 116 in a row.\n\n Crazy right?\n\n I’ve written an email every day for the last 116 days, which is even more than I originally set out to do. You should feel horrible about yourself.\n\n Only the thing is, today is day 14.\n\n I took a long hiatus after day 9 and have been writing a few emails a week for the last week or so. Consider me your fun uncle. Sometimes I disappear for while but when I'm around it's a great time.\n\n Now that you’re all caught up let’s get down to business…\n\n In college, I used to take chops a few nights a week.\n\n If you don’t know what a chop is, it’s when you put weed and tobacco in a bong and clear it in one hit.\n\n It’s the craziest head rush a few dollars worth of weed and a fifth of a light blue American Spirit can buy.\n\n The thing about chops is they’re not entirely pleasant.\n\n You usually start spinning and feel like you’re gonna throw up.

If you’re still here reading and any of this made sense to you, hit ‘reply’ and let me know because I thrive off of your validation.\n\n Anyway, I ate an edible 39 minutes ago and it seems as though it’s starting to hit me.\n\n In order to maintain the legibility and keep the schizophrenia levels to a minimum on this email, I’m gonna end it here.\n\n Goodnight {{ subscriber.first_name }},\n\n Ben",

Kind of tired of doing the same thing everyday and I’m ready to get out of here.”\n\n Many of my friends are about to graduate.\n\n They think the new experience of getting a job and moving to a different city will paint their life with excitement.\n\n And it might for a little bit.\n\n But in a couple years that new routine and new city will once again become mundane and they’ll tell themself the same old lie that they just need to change their environment.\n\n They refuse to ever consider the possibility that the circumstances are not the problem.\n\n They are the problem. \n\n You’re probably the problem in your own life too.\n\n I know I am.\n\n I was addicted to basketball from the age of 9 to 17.\n\n I was sneaking into the gym to workout, always watching film, I even bought a mental performance course from a guy named Taylor Alan.\n\n But all that work I put in never really showed in games.\n\n I was a decent player, I started my junior and senior seasons in high school, but I never dominated the way I knew I could’ve.\n\n And there was always an excuse.\n\n My coach wouldn’t let me play the way I wanted, my teammates didn’t work together, my shoes felt weird, I was hungry, the defender kept grabbing me, etc…\n\n There’s one constant variable here and it was me.\n\n I was the problem.\n\n I couldn’t get out of my own head and just play.\n\n Most of what you want lies on the other side of getting out of your own way.\n\n Stop blaming anything and everything that you’re not where you want to be.\n\n And don’t buy a Herman Miller chair just because your favorite guru has one.\n\n Love you,\n\n Ben",

She asked him the same question.\n\n He told her how exuberant she is. How she lights up a room. And how she’s never afraid to speak her mind.\n\n She prodded a little more by asking him what things that he doesn’t like about her.\n\n He told her that she has questionable decision making when it comes to her friends… and that the reason she was in the hospital is because a few of her friends got in a fight, she ended up in the middle of it and hit her head on the concrete.\n\n The next day another one of her friends walks in. She describes Sarah as loud and crazy. She says that Sarah is hilarious but sometimes doesn’t know when to stop and that’s why the fight started. She goes on to tell Sarah that she instigated the fight and describes the sequence of events leading up to it.\n\n How can this be?\n\n All 3 descriptions that she’s received sound like they could be 3 completely different people.\n\n She wonders who is lying to her and why. But What Sarah doesn’t realize is that each persons’ reality is colored by their perception, made up of their own unique previous experiences.\n\n Hence the disconnect.\n\n In their minds they weren’t lying.\n\n Think the same concept holds true in your life?\n\n Does your mom know the same version of you that your friends do?\n\n Maybe. Maybe not.\n\n Truthfully when I read this, I didn’t really know what to make of it.\n\n My best attempt at describing the message of this story would be something along the lines of…\n\n Stop caring so much about what other people think about you.

    "body": "I became a man recently (I started listening to country music) and feel like a brain-dead monkey for knocking it for the past 22 years. \n\n That has nothing to do with this email, but I thought I’d let you know anyway. \n\n I’ve been going to this Latin Cafe to get a large cafe con leche every morning. \n\n On my way there today, I ran into a younger guy I’d spoken to previously in the sauna (no homo). \n\n He was heading in the same direction, so we walked together, and he started asking about what I do and how this online marketing stuff works. \n\n It got me thinking about what I’d do if I had to start over. \n\n Let’s say I never dropped out of college, and I’m getting my worthless communications degree from Snowflake School in a month. \n\n The looming fear of being a wagie cuck for the rest of my life is growing, so I decide to give a stab at this online business thing. \n\n But I have no skills… \n\n No connections… \n\n And no personal brand… \n\n I’m effectively a female, but I can’t cook or sell my body for money. \n\n Here’s how I’d start all over: \n\n Step 1: Identify what I’m naturally good at and figure out how I can make money with it. \n\n I’ve always been a solid writer, so that’s where I’d start. \n\n This copywriting thing can’t be too hard, can it? \n\n Step 2: Get obsessed \n\n The next few weeks would be spent learning everything I could about copywriting. I’d watch Youtube videos, read books, buy a course or two, etc. \n\n Then I’d write a bunch of sample copy for brands or people that I find interesting and make that my “portfolio.” \n\n Step 3: Ask strangers if you can work for them. \n\n This one’s pretty straightforward. I’d find people that are selling things on the internet and I’d try to start a conversation with them. \n\n In the beginning I wouldn’t mind working for cheap or even free to get some experience under my belt. \n\n It’s really that simple folks. \n\n If you’re in a position where you want to make money online and you’re a decent writer, my friend Mason is hosting a free copywriting class tonight. \n\n He’ll teach you how to make a lot of money as a copywriter (even if you look like a 12 year old boy and you need a step stool to get into your truck). \n\n ​ Register for the class here and tell him I sent you. ​ \n\n Click that link you fucktard ^ \n\n Ben",

Not a cloud in the sky. \n\n If you don’t have a pair of Birkenstocks, you should buy some just for days like this. \n\n I need to cut my toenails, though. \n\n Isn’t it wild that it’s May 1st already? \n\n I swear it was just January, and now we’re nearly halfway through the year. \n\n The other day I took an IQ test once and got an embarrassingly low score, so I was seriously considering the possibility that I am retarded. \n\n I’ve never retained information very well (unless I get obsessed with a topic). \n\n And one time in college, I got lost on the way to the gym that I'd driven to every day for a year. \n\n In all seriousness, I don’t think I’m super intelligent intellectually. \n\n But I’ve always been able to connect with people. \n\n I pick up on things that most people don’t. \n\n I’m either empathetic or good at faking it. \n\n And people seem to trust me easily. \n\n You’re probably like, “okay, Ben I don’t really care about you,” how does this relate to ME? \n\n Give me one more minute, and I’ll explain… \n\n Everything I’m doing in business right now correlates with the skillset I described above. \n\n I can relate to people well, so this helps me write copy. \n\n I don’t want to crunch numbers all day and am not super analytical, so I focus on angles, marketing, and offers more than data. \n\n I’m simply playing to my strengths. \n\n And once you identify your strengths, business gets easier. \n\n If you’re organized, good with numbers, and like stimulants… \n\n …become an accountant for a drug cartel. \n\n If you love talking to people... \n\n …work at a call center and scam boomers out of their retirement savings. \n\n If you’re a hot 20-year-old girl with nothing but air between your ears… \n\n …stop reading this email and go sign up for only fans. \n\n Life gets easier when you bend reality to your advantages. \n\n Alright, I gotta go answer one of my clients' retarded questions. \n\n He’s a good dude, and I love working with this guy, but I swear, every day he’ll ask me one question that makes me want to reply, “Google it, you fucking smooth-brained monkey buffoon.” \n\n But I don’t say that. \n\n I say, “Yeah, brother, great question! Let me fix that right away 👍🏼” \n\n What a display of emotional intelligence. \n\n Wait, last thing if you’re still here - reply to this email and let me know what kind of content you want from me. \n\n Do you like somewhat schizo rants like this? \n\n More in-depth marketing/ copywriting stuff? \n\n Porno’s? \n\n Life-lessons where I use big words and pretend to have this whole life thing figured out? \n\n LMK bb <3 \n\n Ben",

I’ve been blindly typing away on my computer for the last few minutes, so I’m gonna reread this email to see if it makes any sense. \n\n Ok, I’m back. \n\n My intuition told me to stop being a bitch and send this email, so I’m just gonna click the button and go watch a movie. \n\n Gn (or gm if you’re reading this in the morning, which is honestly kind of offensive because I expect you to drop everything you’re doing and read my email no matter where you are at any time of day). \n\n Efkbnehjwkfbnjlknfi, \n\n Ben",

    "body": "Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }}. \n\n It’s been about a week since we chatted, and I’m starting to miss you. \n\n I wrote half of an email the other day and didn’t send it. \n\n It was about “striking while the iron is hot.” \n\n In short, the initial excitement you get about a new project will carry you through the grunt work. \n\n But if you wait to take action for too long - that excitement fades, and you usually never start. \n\n About halfway through, I got distracted and stopped writing. \n\n Ironic right? \n\n Anyway, I would've graduated this past week if I didn’t drop out of college to scam boomers and little kids on the internet. \n\n It’s interesting seeing people I went to school with “fall in love” and get married. \n\n Are they really in love? \n\n Or are they just settling because they think they won’t be able to do any better? \n\n I don’t know. \n\n It just seems so early. \n\n What I can tell you is that if they are settling, it won’t last. \n\n Over the next few years, the white picket fence will begin to decay. \n\n Those little cracks will get bigger. \n\n And eventually, someone will probably cheat with the maid or pool boy. \n\n I don’t mean to be so doom and gloom. \n\n But life gets dull when you’re not working on something new. \n\n You start to wonder what else is out there. \n\n Most cope with this by obsessing over things that don’t matter, starting drama, and worshiping celebrities. \n\n It’s an attempt to make their lives feel like they aren’t pointless. \n\n But what makes life worth living? \n\n Am I doing it the right way? \n\n I’m building businesses, cultivating lasting relationships with amazing people, and working towards going through a pack of zyns daily. \n\n I’ve found a different outlet to occupy my time on this spinning rock. \n\n It feels right, but what’s the end game? \n\n It’s only when I’m able to take a step back and zoom out that I feel like I truly appreciate it. \n\n 18-year-old me would’ve given away his last pack of mango Juul pods to be where I am now. \n\n Still, most days still feel relatively monotonous . \n\n That feeling is what I wanted to escape by taking this route. \n\n Sure, it’s better than sitting in a cubicle with a bunch of they/thems, taking orders from some schmuck who thinks they’re the shit because they make $186,000 per year. \n\n My average client will make more than your annual salary this month, jackass . \n\n But I don’t know if the feeling of monotony ever goes away. \n\n Not matter how exciting things are, \n\n No matter who you know, \n\n No matter who you are, \n\n You still have to get up every day, put your pants on the same way you’ve done since you were 4, and get shit done. \n\n Great things take time, and the work isn’t always fun… \n\n But when you learn to enjoy the work, that’s when life begins to matter. \n\n Take the Lakers - 3.5 tomorrow, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. In order to reach my peak schizophrenic state that I love so much, I'm fasting until 7pm tomorrow. You should join. Reply if you're in <3",

Here we go: \n\n (if you asked me something and I’m not answering it, it’s because it was a stupid question. You should scroll down to the bottom of this email and click ‘unsubscribe’) \n\n 1. What’s the Ben Bader story? \n\n I figured I’d start here to help anyone that’s new get caught up. \n\n Long story that I don’t have the mental capacity to recite. I’m 22 (and still waiting for my brain to fully develop). Here are some recent highlights: \n\n - Dropped out of College of Charleston after 2 years. \n\n - Made my first $100k with a marketing agency for basketball trainers. \n\n - Transitioned to info-products, and now I help big personal brands and “influencers” make more money with their courses and coaching. \n\n - Now living in Miami high rise with a bunch of other idiot monkeys that make a lot of money. \n\n - I also am severely addicted to Zyns. \n\n 2. How do you find clients to work for? \n\n I talk shit on Twitter and have built a bit of a brand there. I share results, and people come to me inbound. \n\n I also get a lot of referrals and work with my close friends. \n\n 3. Since you can work from anywhere, why Miami? Long-term to stay there or move somewhere else, or even buy a second home/apartment somewhere? \n\n All of my friends are here. Good weather. Parents have a condo an hour and a half north. Great place to meet other young entrepreneurs. \n\n I'll likely be in South Florida for a while… not sure how long it’ll be Miami. \n\n Don’t think I’d get a second place any time soon unless it were necessary for biz, or I fall in love with some random girl that lives in bumble fuck Idaho or something lol. \n\n 4. If you were 19 years old and trying to get to $10-15k a month as quickly as possible, what would you do? \n\n If female: OnlyFans. \n\n If male: Learn a high-value skill, pitch a fuck ton of people, get a client, repeat. \n\n It’s really that simple. \n\n Send enough cold messages, connect with enough people, and hack your way into different groups… you’ll find clients. You just gotta look hard enough. \n\n 5. When you think about yourself 10 years in the past or 50 years in the future, does that feel like “Ben at a different time” or “This is a totally different person”? \n\n Ben at a different time. \n\n I thought differently. \n\n I operated differently. \n\n I had a different self-identity. \n\n But at the end of the day, the current me was in there all along. \n\n Okay, enough writing. \n\n There actually were a few other decent questions, but this email is already getting too long. So if I didn’t answer you, don’t take it to heart. \n\n Blame your fellow subscribers, actually. They have the attention span of a gnat, so I know I’ll lose them if I keep rambling. \n\n If you guys liked this lmk, I’ll make this Q&A a weekly thing. \n\n Love you {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I wrote a somewhat legible Twitter thread today. Read it here. ​",

    "body": "One day during my sophomore year of high school, I was talking about confidence with a teammate on my basketball team. \n\n His name is Colin, and he’s probably reading this email along with you. \n\n In that conversation, he said something that stuck with me to this day - hence the email. \n\n I’d asked him how he seemed so unbothered when he missed shots. \n\n He replied, “My confidence isn’t a rollercoaster.” \n\n Colin went on to become the all-time leading scorer at our school. \n\n I was on a walk today thinking about this idea of unwavering confidence. \n\n As I write this email, I’m wrestling with where it comes from. \n\n We can all agree that a large part of confidence is derived from preparation – but it’s not that black and white. \n\n I was obsessed with basketball throughout high school. \n\n I put in as many hours as anyone. \n\n But when I’d miss a few shots, I’d start to hesitate. \n\n When I turned the ball over, I didn’t want it the next play. \n\n My confidence didn’t run parallel to my preparation. \n\n It fluctuated. And when I’d get into a rut, it’d be a downward spiral. \n\n But Colin was almost always emotionless . \n\n Good game, bad game, didn’t matter. \n\n He could miss every shot and still want the ball in his hands with the game on the line. \n\n Maybe the recipe for unwavering confidence goes as follows: \n\n Preparation - emotion = confidence… \n\n Eh. I still think there’s something missing. \n\n There’s an element of confidence that doesn’t rely on preparation. \n\n It’s built on trust. \n\n Ok, wait, that makes sense. \n\n You just watched me hash this out in real-time, so thanks for your patience. \n\n People that have unwavering confidence aren’t prepared for every situation – but they have enough trust in themselves to figure it out. \n\n I could go down the rabbit hole of where that trust comes from, but that would take a lot more critical thinking on my end, and you’re not really helping here. \n\n This newsletter was never supposed to offer profound advice or life lessons anyway. \n\n There’s enough advice out there. I’d rather offer you my perspective and let you agree or disagree. \n\n Last thing I’ve internalized recently: \n\n Your reality acts as a mirror of your self-beliefs. \n\n It’s a common saying in sales that “whoever has the most certainty wins.” \n\n This couldn’t be more true, and it doesn’t just apply to sales. \n\n If your beliefs about yourself aren’t strong, other people's beliefs about you will start to manifest. \n\n If you don’t feel respected by those around you, it's because you don’t respect yourself. \n\n Choose who you are, or let others choose for you. \n\n Sounds simple, but something to consider in your own life. \n\n That’s all for today. \n\n Talk next quarter, \n\n Ben",

It helped me connect with people who became friends and eventually clients. \n\n The skills I’ve picked up have been a byproduct of me telling people I knew how to do things that I didn’t actually know how to do until I figured it out on the fly. \n\n I get to rely on warm inbound leads, my website sucks, I don’t use a CRM, and my offer isn’t easily replicable for each client. \n\n I’m doing everything wrong, but business feels easy. \n\n And I think it’s because I’ve done the hard things right. \n\n It’s taken me multiple years to build my Twitter presence and become a marketing “expert.” \n\n And now everything is coming to a perfect storm. \n\n My network is bigger, and I have the skills/ experience to meet the opportunity. \n\n If I tried to teach someone how to do it the exact way I’ve done it, it’d take a while. \n\n If they wanted quick success, I’d tell them to do a bunch of things that I don’t currently have to do. \n\n But if you want to eventually stumble into a high-leverage position the way I have, do the following: \n\n Post more content & don’t be a dork about it Connect with cool people and be genuine Say yes to any project that comes your way & learn as much as you can Do everything in your power to get amazing results for clients Post more content about those results There’s your simple 5-step system. \n\n Reply if you have questions, and I’ll get back to you within 337 business days. \n\n Sweet dreams, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I’m taking on 5 students for coachi– lmao imagine if I just plugged a coaching offer after basically telling you how you’re too retarded to do what I do like an absolute asshole.",

You’re a stranger reading my inner dialogue, and I don’t know what you’re thinking on the other side of the screen. \n\n Next. \n\n 2 - Everything is a mental game. \n\n I cold-plunged yesterday for the first time ever. \n\n The first 5 minutes were torture. \n\n I kept telling myself to get out. \n\n But eventually, that voice got quieter. My body went numb, and 15 minutes later, I felt like a new man. \n\n This mental fortitude shined through for the rest of the day in my mental state and the way that I spoke to people. \n\n I guess this relates to my first point. \n\n 3 - With enough input, your desired result will unfold. \n\n Some of the pieces of content I’ve put out recently kinda flopped. \n\n Each of which I posted thinking, “This is a banger.” \n\n Apparently, they weren’t. \n\n But that’s okay. \n\n Some of my favorite artists put out hundreds of songs before they had one pop. \n\n If your results dictate your consistency, you will fail before you give yourself the chance to succeed. \n\n Hmm. \n\n Maybe all of these half-baked thoughts are intertwined. \n\n Maybe this email was somewhat coherent. \n\n I think there’s a deeper lesson in there, but I’ll leave it up to you to connect the dots. \n\n I’d continue on with this stream of consciousness, but it took me 3 tries to sound out the spelling of consciousness. \n\n I think that means it’s time to turn off my brain. \n\n Have a good week {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Ben",

    "body": "I planned this email out in my head earlier today. \n\n But right now, I’m hesitating to write it. \n\n I was gonna tell you about how the need for confidence becomes a crutch. \n\n I had a story prepared that demonstrated this example perfectly. \n\n I was gonna tell you how I was sitting at lunch today when I saw a pretty wooman walking by. \n\n Instinctually I thought, “I should go up to her,” but I didn’t. \n\n My brain came up with a thousand reasons as to why that’d be an outrageous thing for me to do, and I talked myself out of it. \n\n I told myself I didn’t have the confidence to do that right now. \n\n I wasn’t wearing a watch. \n\n I was dressed like a toddler. \n\n It was a bad hair day. \n\n Maybe I’ll do it another day when I’ve done the inner work to build up my confidence, and I look a little more presentable. \n\n So I let the opportunity pass me by, and now I’ll never be able to impregnate this pretty stranger. She could’ve been my wife. \n\n The thing is, it wasn't confidence that I was lacking. \n\n It was courage. \n\n And having the courage to act in the face of uncertainty is how you build confidence. \n\n It lets you use real-life examples to change the story you tell yourself about who you are. \n\n You give your brain data that says, \"{{ subscriber.first_name }} you are this type of person. Remember when you did XYZ even though you were nervous?” \n\n When you stop relying on confidence, you’ll no longer need it. \n\n Because no amount of inner work – no amount of money – no fancy watch will magically turn you into someone that you’re not right now. \n\n Only actions can do that. \n\n Last point to drive this home: \n\n Every star basketball player has bad games. \n\n There were times when Kobe would go 3/14 throughout a game. \n\n He literally holds the NBA record for the worst single-game shooting percentage when taking 5+ shots. \n\n Yet he still wants the ball in his hands with one minute to go… no matter how the previous 47 minutes have gone. \n\n Not because he’s feeling extra confident to step up to the plate that day. \n\n But because in his world, confidence doesn’t exist. \n\n It doesn’t matter. \n\n And he doesn’t need it because he replaced it with courage. \n\n Rip Kobe. Makes me sad just thinking about it. \n\n Anyway, I’m not gonna send this email. \n\n Instead, I’ll write a less personal email that makes me look like a perfect, confident person. \n\n If you received this, no, you didn’t. \n\n Miss her man, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Good article that Kobe wrote about obsession ​ \n\n P.S.S. Chat GPT graded my email a 7/10 because I spelled woman with two O’s, and “impregnate this pretty stranger” wasn’t professional. Fukk you, Chat GPT \n\n ​",

    "body": "You’re in a hallway. \n\n It’s a narrow hallway with white walls and fluorescent lights. \n\n There’s a row of wooden doors on both sides. \n\n You’re looking for a golden key. \n\n You try one of the doors on your left, but it’s locked. \n\n In a moment of panic, you turn and start running down the hall, past the other doors. \n\n Eventually, you see a door with golden light shining from under it at the end of the hallway. \n\n You make your way down and open the door. \n\n There’s an empty room with an arrow on the wall pointing toward a new door on the right. \n\n You walk to the new door and open it. \n\n Another arrow and another door. \n\n In the next room, you see the same thing. \n\n You continue to follow the according arrows and open new doors. \n\n Finally, you reach a room with glowing walls. \n\n And on the floor in the center of the room, you find the key you were searching for. \n\n You grab the key and get out of the hallway. \n\n On your way out, you look back at the hallway. \n\n And you see all the locked doors that you’d run past on your way to the first door were now open. \n\n What I’m describing isn’t a psych ward or a never-ending maze. \n\n It’s the law of surrender. \n\n Many of the paths you take in life will lead you to the next path – a better-suited path… \n\n IF and when you’re ready. \n\n But you can’t unlock the next path until you’re ready. \n\n And if you spend too much time banging your head against the wall in one path, the next one will never illuminate. \n\n Let’s bring this back to earth a bit. \n\n When I was a junior in high school, I gave up my lifelong dream of playing college basketball. \n\n I saw the signs that it wasn’t for me, and I listened. \n\n I let that dream die. \n\n A similar thing happened that led me to drop out of college and dissolve my first business. \n\n The thing is, I never got a direct tap on the shoulder telling me it was time to move on. \n\n The universe whispers, I had to be quiet enough to hear it and surrender my control to trust it. \n\n Looking back, I can see that those decisions led me right to where I needed to be. \n\n But this wasn’t evident until I got there. \n\n I gave you this analogy to show you this: \n\n There is power in knowing when to surrender your control and follow your intuition. \n\n When things aren’t working, no matter how hard you try to force it, it could be a sign that you’re missing a key. \n\n And to find that key, you’ll need to open a different door. \n\n Allow life to surprise you. It always knows. \n\n - Ben \n\n P.S. If you’ve noticed I’ve been more consistent with these emails, you’re right. This is a bit Hubermanesque, but I’ve built a ritual for myself when I want to enter creative mode. Dim lights, music in the background, lit candle & a zyn. \n\n Try building a ritual for yourself when building a new habit. \n\n P.P.S. Check out this podcast episode - trust me. ​ \n\n ​",

And if no one gets through it, no one will buy. \n\n This leads me to my second point… \n\n 2 - Reading good copy \n\n You’re already subscribed to the best newsletter in the world (mine). \n\n Why not add a few more? \n\n Seeing different writing styles and the way various arguments are made will help you be more creative in your own writing. \n\n Any time you see a good ad, sales page, email, etc. – save it. \n\n I have a folder with 200+ funnels on my bookmarks tab. \n\n I suggest you start to build one of your own. \n\n Last and final point… \n\n 3 - Thinking & doing other shit \n\n Many of my best realizations and ideas have come while doing something that isn’t writing. \n\n One time I basically wrote an entire sales page in my head while I was at the gym. \n\n I got home, and I just transcribed my brain onto a doc. \n\n You need to give your mind quiet time to think. \n\n The more you understand yourself and the way you operate – the more you’ll understand the world. \n\n And a vast array of experience will give you a wider perspective which translates to you being a better writer. \n\n Alrighty, this was a lot easier today. \n\n If you actually implement anything I told you to in this email - you’ll become a better writer. \n\n Thanks for reading, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Here’s a 3-minute info-product marketing masterclass for you ​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "Every Sunday, I go for a ~2-mile run around this riverwalk close to my apartment. \n\n To be clear – I’m not an apple-watch-wearing cardio dork. \n\n But I enjoy getting out in the sun, and running provides a great opportunity to fight the voice in my head that wants to be lazy. \n\n So today, I threw on my running shoes and went over to the path. \n\n It’s almost always crowded, so I’ve made it a competition in my head when I see other runners in front of me. \n\n My pace fluctuates a bit when I’m more motivated or going downhill versus uphill. \n\n But there are two scenarios where I drastically increase my speed. \n\n When I see someone in front of me, I turn on the jets. \n\n I try to run by them as fast as I can, so they feel bad about themselves they decide to stop running altogether (this is my attempt to make the riverwalk less crowded). \n\n On my way home today, I was coming up on this big intersection. \n\n Usually, it takes about 25 seconds to walk across. \n\n By the time I got up there, the countdown signal to cross the street was down to 4 seconds. \n\n I had two options… \n\n One - Stop and wait 2 minutes for the lights to turn red again. \n\n Or two - Hit the gas. \n\n I put my head down and ran faster than I had all day. \n\n If I didn’t, maybe I would've ended up on someone's windshield based on how aggressive drivers can be in Miami. \n\n My point – I ran the fastest when I absolutely had to. \n\n Faster than when I’m tracking down another runner. \n\n And faster than when I feel more motivated. \n\n Because nothing can induce speed the way necessity will. \n\n If you emptied your bank account and had to make a certain amount of money, or you’d be homeless in 30 days – you’d figure out a way to get it done. \n\n At that point, motivation doesn’t matter, it’s just a buzzword. \n\n It’s easy to take action when you have no other option, but it gets harder once you’ve had some success. \n\n Let’s say you’re making decent money with X business model. \n\n You want to pursue Y business model, but right now, X is paying for your lifestyle. \n\n What I’ve done, and perhaps the practically “sound” decision, is to start Y on the side while maintaining X. \n\n Once you’re making good money with Y, you transition into doing it full-time. \n\n Logically it makes sense – but here’s where it gets dangerous. \n\n If there's an idea that’s been on your mind for a while and you haven’t acted on it yet, it could be because your current situation offers you too much comfort. \n\n And if that idea lingers for long enough without the according action, it’ll drive you crazy. \n\n Maybe that’s when you consider burning the boats. \n\n ​ You’ll figure out how to swim when you’re in the water. ​ \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I’ve made my clients millions of dollars online, and I don’t know the difference between a metaphor and an analogy. I thought this running story was an analogy, but Chat GPT told me it was a metaphor. Maybe AI will replace us.\n\n P.P.S reply if you liked this email <3\n\n ​\n​",

About to watch this Tai Lopez rant if you wanna watch it with me (no homo) \n\n P.P.S Banger analogy from Chat GPT: \n\n It's like setting off on a cross-country road trip without a map or GPS. You have an idea of your destination – it's a city you've always dreamed of visiting. But without understanding the terrain, the distances, and the possible roadblocks, you'll likely end up lost or going in circles. Along the way, you need to gather information, learn how to navigate, and understand the characteristics of your vehicle. Similarly, following your passion without developing relevant skills and acquiring necessary knowledge can lead to frustration or even failure. Experience and understanding of the real-world terrain of your passion is crucial to reach your desired destination.",

Only converted from one form to another. \n\n This is where it gets problematic. \n\n We’re naturally hardwired to stalk our prey, attack, and kill. \n\n But the sad truth for most people is that they become their own prey. \n\n Instead of finding a new outlet for that obsession, they try to stuff it down. \n\n The world tells them who they should be, obsession is bad, and that they need to find balance. \n\n So they listen. \n\n Next thing you know, these are the people that are addicted to drugs, alcohol, gambling, porn, etc. \n\n And perhaps just as miserable are the ones who bury their obsession to the point where it doesn’t have one of the above outlets. \n\n They are the ones who eat themselves from the inside out. \n\n They become obsessed with attacking themselves, overthinking, and fantasizing about what life could be like if they were dealt a different hand. \n\n Because no matter what, you can’t outrun obsession. \n\n It’ll eat you alive. \n\n In 1854, Henry David Thoreau wrote, “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them.” \n\n You can’t outrun obsession. \n\n Find an outlet for it -- And do it every day. \n\n Unless that outlet is black tar heroin. \n\n Thx for reading -- Reply and LMK your thoughts on this topic, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

Why are you doing this? Get me out of here. Joe Rogan is a liar. Ok seriously get out.” \n\n But then I take a deep breath and relax. \n\n I loosen the muscles in my body that are tensing up and tell myself it’s really not that bad. \n\n And after a minute or so, the pain goes away. \n\n Or maybe it doesn’t dissolve – but I learn to tolerate it. \n\n Either way, it’s an interesting dynamic. \n\n There are a few analogies we can pull from this. \n\n The most obvious one is “run towards fear. Pleasure is on the other side of pain, blah blah blah.” \n\n It’s a valid point, but I’m not gonna bore you with David Goggins-themed motivation. \n\n I think there’s a deeper lesson here that may or may not resonate with you… \n\n We feel pain when we resist our true selves. \n\n It creates an internal conflict where the image that we’re presenting to the world isn’t congruent with our core belief system. \n\n Because saying what you want to say and showing others who you really are, sounds intimidating. \n\n It makes you vulnerable. \n\n So you’d rather hide. \n\n It’s more comfortable to just paint on a fake smile, fake personality, and fake belief system. \n\n But after a while, you’ll realize that you’re pretending – and it’ll start to eat you alive. \n\n And then you’re left with a choice. \n\n Do you continue to cover up your authenticity with a bigger shield so that people can’t see in? \n\n Or do you remove the layers that you’re hiding under and stop resisting who you really are? \n\n Because maybe there’s a chance that it was all just a figment of your imagination. \n\n Maybe raw authenticity won’t actually make you vulnerable. \n\n Maybe you’ll unlock the desires that you were chasing and couldn’t catch. \n\n And maybe you’ll finally find peace with that same voice in your head that tells you that the water is too cold. \n\n Or maybe, I’m just kind of sleepy, and this made no sense. \n\n Reply and let me know what you think :) \n\n Talk soon, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

Other people don’t limit you – they allow YOU to limit you. \n\n Let’s say your Mom “makes” your pop tart every morning by putting it in the toaster and clicking a button. \n\n You were never cognizant of how she did it, and now you think you don’t know how to heat up a pop tart. \n\n Extrapolate this to every part of your life, and I think this jumbled-up email will make a bit more sense. \n\n What you’re aware of you’re in control of. What you’re unaware of controls you. \n\n Reply if you liked this one {{ subscriber.first_name }}. \n\n It’s been a while since I used the first name field. \n\n I kinda like saying your name {{ subscriber.first_name }}. \n\n Ok bye {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

You’re constantly thinking about them, and they're going to happen no matter what. \n\n But you also have a laundry list of the things that you kinda want. \n\n Maybe you kinda want to get jacked, take surfing lessons, learn guitar, go on more dates, start a YT channel, etc. \n\n These unclosed loops become death by 1,000 papercuts. \n\n They linger in the back of your head like a gnat that only bothers you occasionally. \n\n Most of the time, you’re not thinking about it, but when it’s buzzing in your ear, you want nothing more than to kill it. \n\n And in life, you’ll get occasional reminders about your “kinda wants” to the point where you’ll eventually need to start tackling them. \n\n They could be completely unrelated to your main thing (the things you can’t not do) and feel like a pointless side quest. \n\n But if they continue to linger, it means there’s something there. \n\n It’s an urge you have to quench. \n\n All this said, I likely won’t be getting a new TV until September 10th (first day of the Bengals football season). \n\n Don’t be like me. \n\n Start attacking one thing that you kinda want today. \n\n ​ And follow me on Twitter plz, ​ \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Chat GPT graded this an 8/10, which is lower than usual. I care more about your opinion bc you’re a real person. Let me know if this one resonated <3 \n\n ​",

Shirts tucked in, pants the perfect length, and Apple watches on their wrists. \n\n It’s 90 degrees outside, and they’ve gotta be burning up. \n\n I can’t help but feel a sliver of guilt as I pass by shirtless – wearing nothing but kill crew shorts and running shoes. \n\n At the age of 22, I have the freedom and am making the money that they’re trading 40+ years of their lives for. \n\n I’m not saying this to sound like a pretentious asshole but rather to point out the inequity of our inputs. \n\n Those of us who are in a similar position to me (where life effectively feels like a video game) are not inherently smarter than those trapped at a desk. \n\n I’d be willing to bet some of those people would smoke us as entrepreneurs. \n\n But the difference is in the way we view the world. \n\n For whatever reason, we were lucky enough to be delusional. \n\n So delusional to the extent that we brainwashed ourselves into believing a different reality was possible. \n\n And this reality rewarded us for our delusion. \n\n No matter where you’re at in life, you’re going to reach a multitude of intersections where you have to make a decision. \n\n Do I continue living in my current reality by telling myself the same thoughts, ideas, and stories? \n\n Or do I change the narrative I tell myself and thus adopt different beliefs that will let me see a new reality? \n\n This might sound a bit “woo woo,” so to put it simply: \n\n The guy hating everyone in tik tok comments lives in a different reality than the guy who’s making $10k/month. \n\n The guy making $50k/month lives in a different reality than the guy making $10k/mo. \n\n And the guy making $1m/month lives in a different reality than any of the above. \n\n To reiterate – these realities are simply made up of the stories we tell ourselves. To change your situation in life, you must change your belief system. \n\n Observe the ever-present thoughts running through your head. \n\n Do they make sense? \n\n Do they serve you? \n\n Do they align with your goals? \n\n OR have you just been identifying with them out of habit? They’ve been engrained so deep into your psyche that you don’t even question them. \n\n Continue to audit your beliefs, continue to discard those which don’t serve you, and continue to watch your dreams unfold. \n\n I must add -- all of this means nothing without taking the according actions and developing skills. \n\n Love you, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. My friend Grant helped me connect the dots and understand this concept - follow him on Twitter if you’re not weird ​ \n\n P.P.S. I ordered a new TV this morning. I know – very courageous of me. If you’re new here and don’t understand why me ordering a TV is a big deal, check out this email from the other day. ​ \n\n ​",

Couldn’t be me. I dropped out of school for a reason. \n\n Okay, I’m stalling now. \n\n What should I write to you about? \n\n Uhhh. \n\n I’ve been thinking about putting together a course or coaching offer for a while now. \n\n I keep going back and forth on what I’d offer, how hands-on it’d be, and what people want to learn from me. \n\n If I built an agency coaching offer, here’s how I’d position it: \n\n I’d start by demonizing the traditional SMMA model. \n\n You may have heard the saying, “An enemy of my enemy is a friend of mine.” \n\n This common enemy tactic is one of the most powerful tools you can use as a marketer. \n\n You’re breaking the beliefs of your audience while simultaneously building a bridge to your solution. \n\n This is how I’d sell you on the “full-stack marketer” business model. \n\n I’d show you how it’s easier to get a few clients to pay you $5k-$10k+ per month rather than try to stack a bunch of clients on cheap retainers and constantly have to do outreach. \n\n I’d tell you how I worked with 50+ clients that paid me $1k per month and how much of a headache that was. \n\n And I’d show you how I now get paid $10k- $30k per month (per client) without needing a huge team. \n\n With enough social proof and personal stories, I’d sell you on the business model, and I’d sell you on me. \n\n Now it’s time to sell you on you. \n\n This offer would be for people that have a client or two as a freelancer, so I’d speak directly to that archetype. \n\n “Since you already have some results, this is the easiest way to scale. You’ll simply be selling more services to someone that already trusts you.” \n\n This is where I’d use language that shows you how I was once in their shoes and transfer my certainty into their soul (if I can do it, you can do it). \n\n This is how successful offers are created. \n\n Sell an audience on a mechanism (business model), sell them on yourself as the authority, and sell them on themselves so they can actually visualize their own success. \n\n Hope this gave you a better understanding of how to extract money from strangers on the internet. \n\n Reply if you liked it :) \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. It's a miracle I finished this email without peeing my pants. You're welcome. \n\n ​",

Your friends are so lucky to be in your circle.” \n\n And now, I feel the need for every word I say to be insightful. \n\n What if I want to talk about Joe Burrow and Cincinnati Bengals? \n\n Or my fear of fat people? \n\n Or how I’m currently seated next to the line to order a coffee, and some dickhead is standing too close to me? \n\n If you couldn’t tell by now, my newsletter is more for me than it is for you. \n\n You’re just an innocent bystander getting hit in the crossfire of the combative thoughts in my head. \n\n Thanks for reading, and as always lmk if you liked this one {{ subscriber.first_name }}. \n\n Have a great Saturday (if the day of the week means anything to you), \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

    "body": "I just got a sugary iced latte from the most liberal coffee shop I could find in Beverly Hills as I start this email from the balcony at my Air BnB. \n\n I’m in a nice residential neighborhood, and my across-the-street neighbor just pulled out in a black Porsche boxter with red rims. \n\n His driveway looks like a luxury car shop. \n\n Along with the boxter, he has a white 911 turbo, a new range rover, and a vintage beige Mercedes. \n\n He drove the 911 yesterday morning. \n\n I’ve become so accustomed to the sweltering heat in Miami that I’m wearing a hoodie on this cloudy 72-degree morning. \n\n The energy here is quite different from Brickell. \n\n It’s more laid back, and there seems to be a constant blue undertone in the sky. \n\n As I think about ways to transition this email to a life lesson, my mind is drawing a blank. \n\n I’ve been stuck for the last few minutes staring at this blinking cursor. \n\n Whenever I feel like my well of original thoughts has run dry, there’s one thing that revitalizes my creativity. \n\n Movement. \n\n I’ll go on a walk, work out, or simply do anything to get myself away from my computer and back in touch with the thoughts in my head. \n\n When I sit at my desk and try to force creativity, it usually eludes me. \n\n The harder you try, the harder it gets. \n\n I’ve realized that much of the progress I’ve made in business has been in times when I don’t feel like I’m trying that hard. \n\n I’ll get obsessed with something for a period of time, and the work starts to feel like play. \n\n I don’t have to force myself to sit at my desk – I simply do it because it’s the obvious thing that I want to do at that moment. \n\n This trait seems to be a blessing and a curse. \n\n It’s made it very difficult for me to do things that I don’t want to do. \n\n In school, I absolutely hated homework. \n\n I’d do anything and everything that I could to avoid it. \n\n And in business, when there are tasks that I don’t feel like tackling, I’ll procrastinate until the final deadline. \n\n Even if it’s something that literally takes me 3 minutes to knock out, it feels like a herculean feat. \n\n Obviously, you can’t always neglect the things you're not excited about. \n\n But there’s definitely a balance between doing work that allows you to enter a flow state and swimming upstream for too long and going in the wrong direction. \n\n Not sure if that makes sense, but I have a handful of things that I’ve been putting off this morning that I need to go do. \n\n They’ll take me about 3 minutes each. \n\n I decided to write this email first because it’s something I actually felt motivated to do. \n\n Weird how that works. \n\n Talk soon, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Check out my recent podcast with Grant Lanin and Cardinal Mason if you haven’t already ​ \n\n P.P.S. Reply if you liked this one (if you feel motivated enough to do so)",

( context if you’re new here ) \n\n He told me I was gonna miss my flight if I didn’t leave right away. \n\n I waited another hour and then left. \n\n Turns out he was a paranoid liar. \n\n I got through security in 3 minutes and had to stand there for an hour before my flight boarded. \n\n And to make it worse, I had to sit next to a very large woman on the plane who wouldn’t stop trying to teach me bad words in sign language. \n\n I was nice to her at first, and that was a mistake because then she attempted to give me her life story throughout the flight. \n\n It got to the point where I was basically pretending to be deaf (hence the sign language). \n\n I wouldn’t wish that experience on my worst enemy. \n\n It’s a cloudy day here in Miami, and my energy is low because of it. \n\n This has been a super jumpy email, and if you’re still reading, I applaud you. \n\n Maybe you’re waiting for a life lesson or something to take away from this. \n\n You’re gonna be waiting for a while because I’ve got nothing for you. \n\n Sometimes I just want to brain-dump, and this was one of those times. \n\n Maybe I’ll teach you how to solve world hunger and make a gazillion dollars tomorrow. \n\n Thanks for wasting your time with me today, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

You should just stay inside and work out here instead,” I think to myself. \n\n I go back and forth for a few minutes before deciding not to cancel this run. \n\n If I get caught in the rain, I’ll be okay. \n\n Four minutes later, I’m outside running, and the wind is picking up. \n\n The people around me are hustling to their cars. \n\n It’s not directly raining yet, but somehow, it feels like I’m getting hit with raindrops from the side. \n\n Considering I’m running by a river, I guess it’s safe to assume the water is being blown from there. \n\n My left shoe is starting to rub against the back of my ankle. \n\n I already have a blister there from the same thing happening the other day. \n\n As I continue along, it starts drizzling. \n\n At this point, I’m honestly excited about the torrential downpour. \n\n But as I get closer to the end of my route, it still hasn’t started. \n\n I think my blister ripped open, but I can’t feel the pain because I’m hunting down the man in a blue shirt about 150 feet ahead of me. \n\n I fly past him, and not too long after, I’m back at my apartment. \n\n That’s actually when I tried to start this email, but I got distracted by a call from a friend. \n\n I then tried to continue it at the coffee shop, but it was far too crowded for me to be able to hear my own thoughts. \n\n You might be thinking, “Ben, is there a reason you just described your morning in vivid detail to me, or are you wasting my time again?” \n\n Oh yeah, I had a metaphor for you. \n\n Long story short, the “rain” is a future obstacle that’s keeping you from attacking a goal. \n\n You don’t start a business because you’re worried about paying taxes (lol). \n\n You don’t ask her out because you’re worried that you’ll look like an idiot. \n\n You don't step in the ring because you're worried you'll get hit in the mouth. \n\n It’s a tale as old as time. \n\n But once you start running toward the things that scare you, you realize that the rain isn’t as bad as you thought it’d be. \n\n Maybe you end up with a bloody ankle, but you don’t care because you’re finally in the game. \n\n It's a feeling of aliveness that money can’t buy. \n\n Don’t rob yourself of this gift – if you get caught in the rain, you’ll be okay. \n\n Thx for reading. \n\n As always, reply if you made it down here <3 \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

He just cycles through a dozen new shirts every few weeks. \n\n About a year and a half ago, I read Jordan Peterson’s book “12 Rules For Life” – and by “read,” I mean I skimmed about 70% of it. \n\n One of his first rules was “treat yourself like someone you’re responsible for helping.” \n\n At the time of reading that, I didn’t think much of it. \n\n But for whatever reason, it’s on my mind as I sit here writing to you. \n\n You have all the answers, you’re just letting your emotions get in the way. \n\n You know how to make more money. \n\n You know how to stop overthinking. \n\n You know how to get over your fears. \n\n And if someone in your exact situation came to you and asked for advice, you’d tell them exactly what they need to hear – even if they don’t want to hear it. \n\n But when it comes to ourselves, it’s like we have blinders on. \n\n We pretend not to know the answers to our problems because this state of “uncertainty” becomes comfortable… \n\n Well, at least more comfortable than the real uncertainty that would occur if we changed what actually needs to be changed. \n\n That make sense? \n\n A lack of clarity isn’t the issue – it's emotion disguised as a lack of clarity. \n\n I just reread that, and I think my breakdown made this concept more confusing than it really is. \n\n Long story short, take the advice you’d give to a friend in your situation. \n\n It’s easy to come up with a solution when it isn’t clouded with fear or doubt – just pure logic. \n\n This was pretty jumbled, but at the end of the day, it’s really just advice to myself. \n\n Maybe I should take it. \n\n Good luck, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

A simulacrum. A Potemkin village. They’re not the real McCoy. \n\n The best example I can think of to illustrate what I’m trying to tell you is cold approach. \n\n You see a girl. You want to go talk to her (if you’re a woman reading this, replace the girl with me, and you’re nervous to come say hi because I’m so famous). \n\n Your brain starts feeding you objections. \n\n “I need to learn how to approach girls first.” \n\n “I don’t know what to say.” \n\n “I actually like men.” \n\n “My shoe is untied.” \n\n Aaaand she walks past you. \n\n The singular action you needed to take to succeed was to walk up and say hello. \n\n But you found all these scapegoats for why that couldn’t happen. \n\n Odds are this exact situation is happening in multiple areas of your life. \n\n A big one for me was content. \n\n I told myself for a while that I’d start making more content once I was making $10k per month. \n\n But I didn’t really put effort into growing on TikTok until I started making over $50k/mo. \n\n And I’m still not making YouTube videos like I wanted to. \n\n The thing is, I’m getting a dopamine hit by telling you this right now. \n\n It gives me an illusionary feeling that I’m moving closer to making YT vids. \n\n The same thing happens when you tell your friends you’re starting 75 hard soon or you’re gonna start training for a marathon. \n\n You get brownie points in your brain but don’t get closer to the goal. \n\n Tricky territory to be in. \n\n The solution is actually to do the singular action. \n\n The unsexy action that you’ve known all along that you needed to do. \n\n Like set up a camera and start talking. \n\n Or walk up to her and say, “Hey, I’m {{ subscriber.first_name }}.” \n\n That’s when you stop fantasizing success (like a cuck). \n\n Love you, and happy blue full superhuman moon or whatever, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. reply if you read all 510 words <3 \n\n ​",

Ugh. \n\n There’s a new grey Ford Bronco parked to my left. \n\n The new models seem to get hate, but I really like them. \n\n If I get a place in LA, maybe I’ll get a 911 and a Bronco… \n\n Stop: 11:47am \n\n Start again: 10:52pm \n\n A lot has changed since I left off here. \n\n I broke my fast a few hours ago, found a mover, and even started thinking about packing up my belongings. \n\n Oh, and I bought a rose gold olive dial Rolex Presidential today. \n\n I didn’t mean to, but I finished my work early for the day and had nothing else to do other than drive 40 minutes to my boy Jamie and buy a new watch. \n\n I don’t want you to think I’m flexing (even though I am). \n\n I’m sharing this with you because I noticed this purchase felt different. \n\n You know all the things that you envision coming with your “dream” life? The car, the girl, the house, the status, etc… \n\n I remember thinking to myself at one point, “Wow, I’ll be so cool once I have Rolex – or Audi – or move to Miami.” \n\n And every time I got one of those things, they lost their lust quickly. \n\n I’d buy them expecting some grand feeling of accomplishment, only to be let down once the lust wore off. \n\n But today, I didn’t feel that. \n\n I bought the watch because I wanted it – I didn’t expect it to make me feel any better about myself or change my perception of who I am. \n\n Dropping those illusionary expectations allowed me to find a different level of appreciation. \n\n Everything that you own, you’ve earned in one way or another. \n\n You have a right to be proud of that. \n\n But understand that the things are not you. They are not a place to source for your own self-worth. And they are not much more than a subtle e xternal trophy for winning internal battles. \n\n Fuck I gotta start packing for tomorrow. \n\n Goodnight, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

We’ll have a technician come out on Thursday, and you’ll be all setup.” \n\n First, I told him I loved him for tracking down the lady and laughed at how she miraculously must’ve been revived from the dead. \n\n And then I said, “Thursday isn’t gonna happen; what can you do here.” \n\n Those nine words saved me 4 days of no wifi. \n\n John (who is now my next of kin in my will) put me on hold for 30 seconds, pulled some Vudu magic, and said, “Ok, your signal will be back tomorrow at 2pm. You’ll just need to plug the router into the wall.” \n\n I’m telling you this whole story for a reason. \n\n There is always a way to get what you want. \n\n Whether you’re building a business, trying to get into an exclusive venue, or want to connect with someone important… \n\n If you’re persistent enough, you will find a way. \n\n Even if it means employing half a dozen Phillipino VAs. \n\n Or harassing staff to get an omelet at 3am (inside joke - if you know, you know). \n\n Go harass an old lady today, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Check out my recent podcast if you haven't already (It’s a banger – I think. But I could also be spewing nonsense – what’s the difference?) \n\n ​",

Ok pretend I didn’t say that. \n\n You can see this in people's eyes – It’s a glimpse into their soul. \n\n The eyes chico, they never lie. \n\n It’s why you get a weird feeling about someone when you meet them, but you can’t explain it, so you just say something's “off” about them. \n\n It’s why you know she’s a good girl at heart even though she’s at the club every night (miss her). \n\n And it’s why you naturally gravitate towards some people more than others. \n\n They’re either truly themselves, and it makes you want to be around them more, or they’re pretending, and you can feel it on a subconscious level. \n\n Here’s a litmus test for you: How many things do you do just because you want to? \n\n There’s no real angle or motive; it just feels like something you were called towards. \n\n That’s why I make content. That’s why I write these emails. That’s why I’m boxing. \n\n These are just mini-side quests that I feel obligated to tackle. \n\n At some point maybe I’ll make money from the content/emails (if I ever get around to building a course), but as of right now, I’m doing it for free. \n\n And I’ll keep doing it even if I never make a dollar from it. \n\n Find the things in your life that you would do every day even if the only benefit is quenching an urge that’s floating in the back of your mind. \n\n Because honestly, doing that will make you feel better than money ever could. \n\n But you need money to allow yourself the luxury. \n\n Thanks for working this out with me. \n\n Have a good Tuesday, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Here's me shamelessly plugging a recent podcast I went on for the 36th email in a row ​ \n\n P.P.S. Reply if you liked this one <3 \n\n ​",

You run your life… you’re not on autopilot. \n\n Do this enough, and maybe you’ll be so enlightened that you end up disheveled, sitting outside of Starbucks, talking to the voice in your head… \n\n Or maybe you end up becoming exactly who you were meant to be. \n\n Missed you, {{ subscriber.first_name }}. \n\n And if you’re new here, welcome. I know you’re probably wondering what you subscribed to, and maybe your finger is hovering over the unsubscribe button. \n\n I was gonna offer an explanation, but honestly this email is long enough.

    "body": "I’m convinced everyone has anxiety and/or depression. \n\n It’s just a matter of what degree they listen to it. \n\n Keep telling yourself bad things, and you will literally program yourself to always think that way. \n\n Those constant negative thoughts end up shaping your entire identity and perception of yourself. \n\n Once a belief is accepted as an unchangeable fact, our malleability gets diminished. \n\n “I am an anxious person” or “I am a depressed person” gets repeated until it’s deeply embedded into someone's psyche. \n\n And on a long enough time horizon, that person forgets that there was ever another option. \n\n An option where they didn't have to give power to their negative thoughts. \n\n Or where they understood they could decide who they are. \n\n And as long as they don’t suppress their true desires, that evil voice gets a little bit quieter. \n\n I don’t think it ever goes away – it just takes a backseat. \n\n Even when you’re living your “dream life,” sometimes you’ll wake up on the wrong side of the bed. \n\n You’ll never be completely immune to occasional highs and lows. \n\n Every now and then, you’ll question everything about your life just hours after thinking you’re invincible. \n\n That fluctuation is inevitable. It’s natural. \n\n And accepting it is part of the solution. \n\n It can be as simple as shifting from “I feel like shit right now, and I hate this” to “I feel like shit right now, and that’s okay.” \n\n Of course, there are times when a negative situation shouldn’t be accepted and instead used as fuel for change. \n\n But I’m talking about the other times where you just seem to hit a wall for no rhyme or reason. \n\n That happens to me all the time. The same goes for almost all of my friends, so I imagine it happens to you. \n\n The secret is discerning when a feeling needs to be accepted and when it needs to inspire change. \n\n Before dropping out of college a few years ago, sometimes I’d quietly get anxious. \n\n Although my life looked fun on the surface, I could simply feel that path wasn’t right for me (emphasis on feel, not think). \n\n There was objectively no fulfillment. \n\n I went out all the time and “celebrated” although I had nothing to celebrate – it was an escape from a life with a lack of purpose, ambition, or improvement. \n\n If I didn’t change, it would’ve eaten me alive. \n\n On the contrary, I’m now in a position that I was enamored by for years. \n\n But that doesn’t stop me from occasionally questioning if I’m an absolute idiot and if I should move across the country to live on a farm with Amish people and cows. \n\n Odds are that’s just a natural low – in fact, I know it is because it feels different. \n\n So when those types of thoughts come up, I try not to give them power. I accept them as they are – the devil who will always be there on my shoulder. \n\n And that’s okay. \n\n Hope this all made sense. Let me know if you made it down here. \n\n Have a good day, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

I’ve been putting off making this 4-minute phone call for 3 weeks now. \n\n I’ll probably continue to procrastinate until I wake up one day and can’t turn on the faucet to brush my teeth. \n\n Today is my first full day being 23 years old. \n\n Birthdays are interesting because they are meaningless unless you give them meaning. \n\n It’s not like you instantly reach a new level of wisdom or get your first grey hair the day after you hit a new number. \n\n The only difference is the perception. \n\n If a 29-year-old degenerate wakes up on his 30th birthday and decides that he’s now too old to smoke weed all day and throw together 19 leg parlays in hopes that $6 will turn into $800, and he changes his actions accordingly; then the arbitrary number now has meaning. \n\n I’m feeling this right now, too. \n\n The perceived gap between 22 and 23 is rather large in my head. \n\n At 22, the bar’s pretty low – simply having my own apartment, a nice car, and smelling nice seemed to be impressive. \n\n At 23, I feel more pressure. \n\n $500k-$1m annually is cute. Enough to feel rich without being anywhere close to it. \n\n My audience should be bigger. I should be employing more people. \n\n It’s honestly embarrassing that I don’t have a supercar. \n\n Why don’t I have $10m liquid? \n\n I’m kind of kidding right now, but I’m really not. \n\n I feel like I’m only tapping into 1/100th of my potential, and having to say a new arbitrary number when someone asks my age is a reminder of this. \n\n Maybe you’re in the same boat, and you know that deep down. \n\n But you’re waiting until it gets bad enough. \n\n You wake up at 30 and realize your bucket list is full of unchecked boxes… \n\n Your bank account hits zero… \n\n You put on so much weight that you can’t see your toes when you look down… \n\n Maybe you’ll change then, maybe you won’t. \n\n Why do we operate this way? \n\n Is an embarrassingly new low the only thing that can inspire change? \n\n It can’t be. \n\n Maybe the answer is to give ourselves a manufactured wake-up call instead of waiting for the arbitrary one. \n\n If you're waiting for a slap in the face, here’s your sign to stop half-assing life while pretending to give maximum effort so you don’t have to accept the fact that you’re neglecting your true potential. \n\n I’m gonna call the water company and update my address. \n\n Happy Saturday, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

You have a lot to be grateful for. \n\n But it’s also likely that you’re currently holding some desires that are causing you anxiety because your actions do not align with them. \n\n It’s okay that you want more – just ensure that you’re taking the necessary action to fulfill those desires. \n\n Enough rambling for today. \n\n Hope this was semi-coherent, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "I’ve spent the last 45 minutes contemplating the best route to more money and more freedom. \n\n The past couple of weeks have been busy, and I haven’t had a chance to spend much quality time alone. \n\n I define quality time alone as the uninterrupted moments between you and the 37 voices in your head. \n\n These are the opportunities that allow you to think critically and perform a mini audit on your life. \n\n I could write a whole email on the importance of prioritizing this and how most people are too sTuCk iN tHe MaTriX to ever figure out what they actually want. \n\n But I’ll spare you today. \n\n I went on a long walk this morning and let my mind wander. \n\n After my walk, I sat down outside Starbucks with a cold brew, and now I’m here writing to you. \n\n Sometimes, just the act of thinking about your “problems” will drastically improve your mental state because you realize how silly they are. \n\n There are people dying, and I’m over here stressing about how I need multi 8 figures by age 30. \n\n 99.9% of the world would trade everything for my “problems.” \n\n I could go on about this, but there are already enough people who talk about gratitude on the internet. \n\n While I was walking, I was thinking about a friend of mine who recently ended up in a sticky situation. \n\n His 7 figure business fell apart nearly overnight, and a series of unfortunate events drastically depleted his bank account. \n\n Scary right? \n\n There’s a level of freedom you reach when everything goes to shit like this — and it gives rewards the equal (or even greater) opportunity if you can get through it. \n\n My friend started a new business and has been on an absolute tear for the last handful of months. \n\n He’s working nonstop but just seems to be electric about the work and thinks that this new business could make him 8 figures over the next few years. \n\n I’ve been envious of the excitement he has for this new project and asked him if he ever has days where he doesn’t want to work. \n\n I’m paraphrasing, but basically he said, “Sure, there are, but I don’t give much power to it. The work just feels like something that has to be done.” \n\n His answer makes perfect sense to me. \n\n He’s not passionate about the day-to-day tasks. He’s not immune to the monotony that comes with building a business. \n\n But the end goal and the vision are big enough that they carry him through the tediousness (plus the situation with his previous business adds some urgency). \n\n My main takeaway here is this: \n\n If the work always feels like a herculean task, you’re playing too small. \n\n When you truly believe that what you’re building has the potential to be special, that passion puts you on autopilot and carries you through the boring stuff. \n\n Take a walk today and think about where you want to be in 5 years. \n\n Clearly envision it – money, lifestyle, relationships, impact. \n\n Do your current daily actions align with that goal? \n\n If not, now you know where to start. \n\n Hope you enjoyed this one. \n\n Much love, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Start paying more attention to the things that come naturally to you. \n\n Write down a list of the things you enjoy doing the most, and do not neglect them. \n\n P.P.S. I am not a self-improvement guru or life coach. My goal is simply to share my perspective through the lens in which I view the world. Nearly nothing I tell you is a universal truth. \n\n Let me know if my perspective resonates :) \n\n ​",

I’m not usually one to be anxious socially – It was just a lot of “new” at the same time. \n\n New city. \n\n New friends. \n\n New routine. \n\n Etc. \n\n I immediately had a solid group of friends who I’d met through social media, but none of us were really “plugged in” here. \n\n And because all of the newness was intimidating to me, I kind of just latched on to the friend group. \n\n I never took the lead or planned anything – I would just go with the flow. \n\n Then, after a few month period where I was almost never going out, I realized that I wasn’t living the fun “Miami lifestyle” I envisioned. \n\n I also started to really despise working. \n\n A $50k month vs a $100k month virtually had no difference to me, so I lost almost all motivation to keep pushing for new numbers. \n\n So I took back control and started doing my own thing. \n\n I hired a boxing coach, went out to new clubs and restaurants, and started meeting new people. \n\n I learned to lean more into my uniqueness and have become more of myself. \n\n And now, I’ve created the exact lifestyle that would play as a movie scene in my head when I pictured moving to Miami a year and a half ago. \n\n I’m sharing all this with you to encourage you to do more. \n\n -- You can grow your business while living the social life you want, trying new hobbies, and keeping up with all of your 16 wives. \n\n -- You feel most alive when you get rid of the scapegoats you may blame for why you’re not as happy as you want to be. Take control of your habits, routines, and decisions. \n\n -- It’s okay to do things for the “sake of it.” You have an inclination to do those things for a reason. \n\n -- Do not settle when it comes to your true desires. Most get a tenth of the way there and justify settling for “good enough” along the way. Fuck that. We want Lambos and Pateks. Not a Model 3’s and Apple Watches. \n\n Alrighty. \n\n Originally, this email was gonna be about my new lock screen on my phone, but I got caught in the zone and felt like this deserved the spotlight. \n\n Maybe I’ll write to you about the new one tomorrow. \n\n Hope you liked it – let me know if you made it all the way down here <3 \n\n Do more, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

But if you can simply bring yourself to do your best in that given moment, you’ll keep moving forward. \n\n Doing your best also applies to your interactions with others. \n\n Instead of worrying about what to say to impress someone or the perfect lines to make a girl fall in love with you – approach interactions with the goal of simply spreading good energy (corny again, but true). \n\n This approach takes all of the pressure away, and It gives you control of any situation. \n\n Switching gears - sometimes, I’ll run into moments like this when I’m writing, and I feel like I’ve completed the entire argument for the point I’m trying to make. \n\n How many more times can I tell you to do your best? \n\n I actually got this “do your best” concept from the book The Four Agreements , and it stuck with me for a few days, so that’s when I decided to make it my phone background. \n\n I’m not gonna keep hammering this into your head – But just start to take note of your goals in different situations. \n\n “Am I anxious when talking to this person because I’m trying to get something out of them or impress them?” \n\n “Am I tired of doing the same monotonous work, so I procrastinate until the last second and then half-ass it, which makes me anxious because I know I could’ve done better?” \n\n In those situations, changing the goal is the solution. \n\n If you go into the interaction aiming to do your best to say what you want to say, or if you approach your work with the goal of doing what you need to in the most effective manner possible… \n\n The anxiety goes away. \n\n You feel your best when you do your best. \n\n Anyway, thanks for reading <3 \n\n If you reply and tell me you love me, maybe I’ll even write another email tomorrow. \n\n Much love, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

No. \n\n But recognizing the freedom and the options that we have will help us understand this: \n\n Everything that is going on in your life right now is a result of decisions you have made. \n\n You choose the stress you allow into your life; you choose the people, the goals, and the perception of reality that you make. \n\n You choose whether or not you want to have difficult conversations with a friend, and you choose whether or not you tell yourself that you’re too hungover to go on your Sunday morning run. \n\n You choose how much of yourself you express when you’re around different types of people, and you choose the way you react when things don’t go as planned. \n\n You choose to hold yourself to a certain standard and to do or not do things that you commit to. \n\n Now, I say all this to show you that if you are unhappy, if you are anxious, or if you feel like you’re not living in alignment with the life you’re meant to live – it’s on you. \n\n You’re actively deciding to live the exact life that you’re living right now, and any conflict comes from failing to accept that decision as your own. \n\n You have more freedom than you’re telling yourself, but you’re making shitty rules that keep you stuck. \n\n Obviously, without any rules, chaos would ensue – just make sure the ones you abide by are actually serving you. \n\n Happy Sunday and go Bengals, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

It makes me wonder how they operate on their own and if they just go throughout their day without water. \n\n 2: We are hard-wired to be obsessed. \n\n If you’re smart, you get obsessed with something that brings you fulfillment and makes you money. \n\n Your purpose is to find the things that are worth obsessing over for you and carry them out to their fullest potential. \n\n This is where you find the flow state. \n\n 3: I’m (probably) not smarter than you. \n\n Sometimes, I see people comment on my videos or reply to my emails saying things like, “How are you so wise for being this young?” \n\n The answer is that I trust myself. I’ve developed enough conviction in my own perception of the human experience that seems to resonate with others. You, too, have the same wisdom if you care enough to listen to it. \n\n 4: Being intentional and setting goals put your subconscious to work. \n\n Almost every time I put “make 2 tik toks” or “write 3 tweets” on my to-do list for the day, my brain starts feeding me ideas. \n\n This applies to any goal or desire in life. \n\n 5: When you utilize money to its maximum ability, you reach a new level of autonomy. \n\n I buy $300 massages a few times per month (no happy ending). I didn’t realize this was “expensive” for a massage until the way a friend of mine reacted when I told them. \n\n It made me think about other little things like this that make me appreciate money – fancy dinners, clothes, sporting events, paid parking, and subscriptions, are all effectively free. \n\n 6: I’m going to bed. \n\n I’m not gonna proofread this, so if it was illegible or I spoke about my disdain for fat people - I’m sorry. \n\n Hope this was half-decent.

    "body": "I’m sitting outside people watching. \n\n One of my biggest fears is becoming one of those people who love to tell you about how it all goes downhill after 40. \n\n This fear was brought to my attention as I just watched this woman mock her husband's hand gesture when they crossed the street with their elderly parents/in-laws. \n\n It was a small interaction that I’m sure the two of them forgot about in the following 30 seconds. \n\n But is that just what happens when you spend years with someone? \n\n The way they breathe, the way they sit, the way they chew, and the mannerisms they use while doing certain activities just become annoying. \n\n Maybe this is why I like speed dating. \n\n I had a series of brief relationships throughout college that felt like eternities. \n\n Over the course of two weeks, we’d spend nearly every day together, share phone locations, and I introduced one of them to my parents on our 3rd date. \n\n Then I’d usually get tired of the girl and all the little things she’d do would start to bother me. \n\n The way her ponytail bounces when she walks, the brief moment where both of us would open our eyes at the same time when we kiss, the way she sleeps, etc. \n\n I’d be silent about these things though and then completely blindside her when I pull away. \n\n I’ve changed I promise. \n\n And it’s not that I’ve never been in long-term relationships or haven’t met girls that make it past the 2-week honeymoon. \n\n It’s just that it has to stay really fast-paced and exciting for me to be able to overlook the inevitable icks. \n\n The finance bros just walked out of Starbucks and are heading back to the office. \n\n That scares me too. \n\n Fake smiles, the same 5 shirts they rotate through each week, taco Tuesdays with the wife, beer night and football on Thursdays with the boys, and a 401k that leaves you with just enough money for low-budget vacations twice a year. \n\n To me, it just sounds like a slow, silently painful death that starts the day where you can semi-accurately predict what the rest of your life will look like. \n\n I guess that’s what I’m scared of. \n\n Too much predictability. Complacency. Living the same day for 50 years. Losing the spark with a girl and staying in the relationship only because finding someone else would be too hard. Or when the most exciting part of the day is hitting the green light at the busy intersection on the way home from work. \n\n Does the spark inevitably fail after a while or is that a lie that’s been perpetuated by these doom and gloom water cooler conversation and “wait till you’re 40” types? \n\n Or are they actually the enlightened ones because they’re able to seem outwardly content with the “simple life” and I just don’t have enough appreciation for the little things? \n\n Maybe. These are questions I don’t have the answers to. \n\n For now, I’m gonna go get the same tacos I eat every day for lunch, hop on the usual 3 pm meeting, hit the gym, and call it a day. \n\n Ooh, it’s chest day. If it’s not too crowded and I can get a bench that’ll be the highlight of my day! \n\n Some good basketball on tonight too. \n\n Will circle back tomorrow! \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

You will never experience the depth of life if you don’t attack the things you want and shape your reality to your imagination. \n\n Just don’t forget to stop and enjoy the moment once you get there. \n\n I guess this did turn into a motivational guru email, but I hope you liked it.\nLet me know if you did – and finish your Untitled Documents. \n\n $1,000 on black, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

I like the ever-present blue tint in the air. \n\n “It would be impossible to be unhappy living here.” I think. \n\n And that’s when I stop and catch myself. \n\n I already live in paradise. \n\n Minus the aesthetic of the hills and homelessness, Miami is basically the same thing. \n\n And I’m not unhappy in Miami at all – I’ve absolutely loved it recently. \n\n But that thought of “better” still crept in. \n\n That singular thought has the potential to be cancerous. \n\n Imagine you’re dating your dream girl (or dream man if you're a girl). \n\n She’s gorgeous in that unique, innocent way that you just don’t see every day. \n\n You guys get along perfectly. She’s clever, she can banter with you, and most of the time, you know what she’s thinking before a word comes out of her mouth. \n\n It’s that kind of chemistry that makes other couples fight after seeing you out because it makes them question the depth of their relationship. \n\n But one day, you start to develop eyes for a different girl. \n\n She’s equally beautiful, and you’re intrigued. So you start fantasizing about girl number 2. \n\n “What would life be like with her? I bet she wouldn’t get mad at me for leaving the toilet seat up the same way my girl does.” \n\n And here comes the poison. \n\n You start observing your girl in a different light. \n\n The things you loved about her begin losing their luster. \n\n You think more and more about what she does wrong and what you don’t like about her. \n\n Over time, your relationship is silently in shambles. Neither of you have acknowledged it yet, but you’ve been fighting way more about little things. \n\n You’re no longer the person she fell in love with, and you’ve warped your perception of her to the point where you think she’s the problem. \n\n Eventually, it all goes up in flames, and you find your way to girl number 2. \n\n Except she’s not just number 2. \n\n You’ve ben doing this countless times with nearly everything in your life. \n\n You get what you want, and stop watering your own grass. \n\n You slowly poison it, evade to the next one, and start all over. \n\n This is a vicious cycle – Water your own grass and be careful of these thoughts that there is always something better. \n\n They will sprout quickly, and soon enough, you’ll live in a forest full of poison. \n\n Avoid looking for problems where there are none – because you will find what you seek. \n\n The grass is always (and never) greener when you fail to water your own, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I had fun with this one. My creativity is way better here than it is in Miami. I think I’d like it here better, for sure. After all, the constant reggaeton in Miami gets annoying. And everythings so congested! Hmmm. \n\n P.P.S. ^ that is sarcasm to illustrate my point if you’re slow and didn’t catch it. \n\n ​",

Get to work, and your passion will find you. \n\n When I first started playing basketball as a kid, I had no idea that it would consume the following decade of my life. \n\n I figured, “What the hell?” I’ll try this thing out and see if I like it. \n\n A few years later, I was still lukewarm – I enjoyed the sport and was decent for my age, but it wasn’t too serious. \n\n Then I started working with a trainer who played in college. \n\n I still remember walking into the gym in my first session with him and seeing orange cones sprawled across the hardwood. \n\n And the following workout changed the course of my entire life. \n\n It was the most challenging 1.5-hour session I’d ever done – and in those moments, I fell in love with the pursuit of mastery. \n\n For the next 7+ years, this pursuit of mastery became my life. \n\n I cherished the times when I’d walk into an empty gym. \n\n The sound of the ball hitting the court was like music to me. \n\n I felt completely present, and that’s when I knew I was alive. \n\n The thing about this feeling is it can never leave you. \n\n It’s almost like you can’t unsee it once you see it. \n\n If you’ve ever been obsessed with something and have spent every waking hour at your disposal consumed by said thing, you can never go back. \n\n If and when that thing ends, that fire is still in you, and it must be transmuted into something else, or it will burn you alive. \n\n But let’s rewind real quick. \n\n I got so distracted by the power of obsession that I forgot why I started this email. \n\n It’s no secret that life without purpose is a bland life. \n\n Everyone wants to “find their passion,” but few seem to do so. \n\n The problem is people assume that this intensity towards a calling is just gonna slap them in the face one day. \n\n They’ll just be frolicking through the dairy aisle and get hit with a carton of milk that says, “Dedicate your life to XYZ.” \n\n Not how it works. \n\n You have to go out there and hunt. And after hunting for a while, maybe you’ll find your prey. \n\n But if you don’t, that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It simply means you aren’t opening enough doors. \n\n You’re not giving luck enough of a chance. \n\n So you keep hunting and building until you realize that you’ve found exactly what you’re looking for. \n\n And when you stop and pause, you’ll see that passion actually did slap you in the face. It was already inside of you, and you just had to let it out. \n\n Happy Monday {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

It’s a surreal feeling. But life goes on. \n\n And all you’re left with is the question: \n\n Now what? \n\n However, there’s been one common theme that hasn’t sat right with me among my bigger purchases. \n\n I’ve always waited for some arbitrary permission. \n\n I bought my Audi days after a friend bought a new car and the same goes for my first couple Rolex’s. \n\n I’ve told myself I need to get to a certain revenue milestone before making other purchases. \n\n That’s one trait I’d like to discard. \n\n An ungovernable man does not need to justify his desires with made-up rules. \n\n He simply listens to his own voice and follows his intuition at his own speed. \n\n The other day I woke up with a visceral urge to buy a Porsche 911. \n\n It’s always been my dream car, and I’ve found myself talking about it a lot recently. \n\n Here’s a pic of my new turbo. \n\n Hope you’re having a good Tuesday :) \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. The game never ends, and you never win. \n\n You simply collect a combination of trophies and battle scars along the way. \n\n The collection of these memories is the actual \"win\" because it means you're living a full life full of a variety of perspectives and experiences. \n\n Go get everything you want. \n\n But just know that they're trophies to add to your shelf -- not the end goal. \n\n ​",

I certainly couldn’t. \n\n And then this Asian girl walked out of Starbucks really quickly and really… hard. \n\n I’m not sure how else to explain her strut. \n\n It was like she was exerting all of her force into each step and swaying aggressively from side to side. \n\n Similar to the way you’d see the nerdy, overly excited, yet timid girls walk in school. \n\n I didn’t even mention the homeless man to my left, who’s been murmuring random sentences for the last few minutes, but let’s move on. \n\n Often times when I don’t have an immediate idea to write about, I’ll start the email the way I did above. \n\n Just a bunch of random little observations of my surroundings. \n\n Maybe that’s a lesson. \n\n I feel much more present now than I did a few minutes ago. \n\n I also think it helps put me in a different state where I no longer approach this blank page with the thought of “I need to think of something to write about.” \n\n But rather, I just start writing, and whatever comes to mind goes on the page. \n\n Let’s extrapolate these two things to life: \n\n You know how all guided meditations start with presence? \n\n “Focus on your breathing, feel the seat beneath you, place your attention on your chest, etc.” \n\n It serves as a reminder that you are here — where unless you’re in some immediate danger or physical pain, nothing is wrong. \n\n And when you’re fully present this way, that’s when you’re at your best. \n\n Ok, quick detour, the homeless guy to my left is starting to get into an aggressive argument with someone in his head and growing increasingly loud. \n\n If he mistakes me for the person in his head, I’m ready to throw hands with this guy. \n\n He just got up and scurried away. \n\n It’s interesting because I’ve seen this guy in particular a lot and sometimes he’s been semi-normal. \n\n I heard him having a conversation about the Ohio State and Michigan football rivalry, and it sounded perfectly sane. \n\n I guess that’s schizophrenia for ya. \n\n I’m sidetracked now and forget what I was gonna say before that detour. Ironic for an email about presence. \n\n Anyway, the last thing I’ll share with ya... \n\n My agency has consistently been over $100k a month for a few months now while working with just 6-9 clients at a time. \n\n A few notes: \n\n Rev shares are how you make real money with an agency Getting clients through inbound and referrals is far superior to cold outreach. Do not be afraid to sacrifice some margin and delegate — this has been a big one for me as I started to feel burnt out with client work. Learning direct response copy is the first fundamental skill you need. Over time you can add complementary skills that make you more valuable to businesses. Alrighty, that’s all for today. \n\n If you have any specific questions - whether it’s about business or anything else I ramble about here, reply and lmk <3 \n\n Ben \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "Let’s talk about business. \n\n If you have zero clue what I do and how it works, here’s a brief TLDR: \n\n I run a marketing agency where I work with many of the big personal brands that you see online with hundreds of thousands of followers. \n\n Over the last few months, we’ve consistently been over $100k per month with minimal expenses. \n\n I have a team of 3 people, and we work with around 7-10 clients at a time. \n\n The majority of clients we work with are making anywhere from $100k- $600k per month selling info-products and coaching programs. \n\n Most of the revenue we bring in as an agency comes from our 10-20% performance fees on the revenue we generate. \n\n Our bread and butter as an agency are webinars and new product launches. \n\n We provide full-stack services to our clients, meaning we build their funnels, script VSLs, script and build slides for webinars, run email marketing, and provide a few other services, including general consulting. \n\n All of our clients come to us through referrals and my Twitter account. \n\n Make sense so far? \n\n Here’s how I ended up here: \n\n A few years ago, I started a different agency working with basketball trainers. \n\n I was able to work with many of the trainers you may see on social media that had big audiences, and in that process, I got really good at one thing: \n\n Getting people to take action through the written word, otherwise known as copywriting. \n\n I also accumulated a handful of other skills that I use with the clients we work with, including funnel building, backend system setup, and a deep understanding of info-product businesses as a whole. \n\n I don’t know how this all may relate to you, but perhaps you’re an agency owner or freelancer who wants to make more money with fewer clients. \n\n Here are some of the biggest things I’ve learned in going from $25k/mo - $100k/mo+ over the past year: \n\n The real money is in revenue shares. To be able to get rev shares where clients pay you $20k+ without batting an eye, you must become irreplaceable in their business. This is where the multitude of services we offer (and do better than 99% of other agencies) comes in handy. You need a team, but hiring doesn’t have to be difficult. I’m a horrible operator, and I didn’t want to have to babysit new team members I brought on. So, my team consists of 2 of my closest who were already very skilled in the work we do. And although I sacrifice some margin, it saves me so much time and headache that I would have if I tried to do everything on my own. Client results & personal brand is the best form of outreach. Two months ago, I closed a new client who found me through Twitter and knew some of the people we work with. He’s paid us over $50k, mostly from our performance fees. I have opportunities like this come up frequently because of the two assets I mentioned above (client results & personal brand). Do not be afraid to cut ties with clients when things are not going the way you need them to. I am selective with who I bring on, and I’ve learned that short-term cash is never worth the headache when I see red flags. I turn away most of the prospects that book calls with me if they don’t fit the criteria that I know we need to succeed. If you’re working in a similar type of business, I hope this helps. Feel free to reply and fire away with any questions. \n\n Let get richer, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "When I stepped foot on a college campus 4 years ago, I had no intentions of joining a fraternity. \n\n Rush week started, and I began going to parties and events with my roommates \n\n If you don’t know how the whole Greek life thing works; basically rush week is when all the frats throw these parties and events to recruit new members. \n\n After that week, I figured this whole pledging thing couldn’t be that bad. \n\n Next thing you know, I got a bid and became a pledge in a fraternity. \n\n This is not the fun part. \n\n For the next 3 months, my 11 pledge brothers and I were constantly running errands for the members of the frat, setting up events, and of course, having our fair share of… “welcome to the frat” moments. \n\n If you know me, you know I love my time. \n\n There are few things I dislike more than feeling like I’m not in control of where I go and what I do. \n\n Pledging a fraternity completely ate up all my time. \n\n There was a moment early on when I was thinking about dropping (quitting). \n\n It was maybe 2 weeks in, and I started to come to the discouraging realization that this wasn’t going to end any time soon. \n\n I was going back and forth thinking about it and honestly was ready to get out of it. \n\n But by that time, I’d made a couple of close friends, and I didn’t want to bail on them. \n\n I also felt an obligation to myself to finish what I unknowingly started. \n\n So I did. \n\n I would’ve never pledged had I really known what I signed up for, but once I was in it, I couldn’t bring myself to back out. \n\n The words that come to mind when I think about this situation are the following: \n\n “You’re already this far in; you might as well finish the job.” \n\n And if we extrapolate this to life or business, it’s a valuable lesson to pull from. \n\n The hardest part of doing anything new is the beginning. \n\n You suck at the thing. It sucks. And change is hard. \n\n But once you start, inertia starts to build. \n\n Even when you keep getting caught with a right hook… \n\n Or a prospect cusses you out and hangs up on your cold call… \n\n Or you look like an idiot in front of your date because you stumble over your words and accidentally tell the waiter, “you too,” when they say, “have a good meal.” \n\n Momentum carries you through the shitty parts like this. Once you’re in, there’s no going back because it’s like you can almost taste what the other side will be like. \n\n Yesterday, I was reminded of this very concept. \n\n I sat down to record a YouTube video, and 36 tries later, when I was about to quit, I told myself that this was my last try and I was following through with it no matter what. \n\n I imagined how I’d feel after finally making and uploading the video. \n\n And I told myself, “You’re already this far in; you might as well finish the job.” \n\n ​ You can watch that video here. ​\n\n Hope you’re having a good week, and show some love on the YT vid if you like it :) \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

All the employees are wearing reindeer ears and the male barista attempts to hold eye contact with me for a few milliseconds too long. \n\n I evade and tell him to make me an $8 iced latte with vanilla. \n\n Before I got here, I was scouring my apartment. I tore up my office, dug under the couch, swept through the kitchen, and even looked in my bathroom although I knew there was little chance I’d find what I was looking for in there. \n\n It’s not that I even wanted to find the item that bad, it’s that I knew it was there somewhere which was driving me crazy. \n\n But for now, I’m listening to Christmas music at this cafe because I had no luck finding my airpods. \n\n I rarely wear headphones. But when I do, it’s because I’m in a noisy area and I want to write. Listening to my own music helps me feel like I’m in my own world where I can ignore the dorky-looking man at the counter to my right wearing a fanny pack around his shoulder. \n\n I literally remember putting them on my counter yesterday. \n\n Maybe someone broke into my apartment, ignored the expensive watches, my car keys, and any other more valuable items they could’ve taken, and decided to run away with my disgustingly earwax-stained airpods. Hahaha. \n\n I had something I wanted to write to you about, but I’ve gotten so sidetracked that I completely forget it now. I guess it’s just that kind of morning. \n\n Something that’s been on my mind however is career paths. \n\n I don’t understand how people can stay in one role in the same field for more than a few years. \n\n Especially as entrepreneurs. Maybe I’m just immature, but thinking about doing the same exact thing I’m doing now for the next 3 years makes me want to chew glass. \n\n Sure you can always make the argument that “feelings don’t matter. Do it anyway” blah blah. \n\n And I know there will always be some things I don’t want to do in any business I run. But to me it just makes sense to upgrade or switch business models every few years (if that’s what feels right). \n\n I get bored doing the same thing every day after a while. \n\n Again, you can make a sound argument that it doesn’t matter how you feel and that you should power through the things you don’t want to do. \n\n But you can also make the counterargument that if you can find excitement in your work, you’ll be much more effective than when you’re dreading it. Even if that means your business model has to change or evolve every so often. \n\n Last point on this and then I gotta run: I’m not saying you should constantly be jumping from one completely different business to another. \n\n You likely have innate skills that can be applied in a variety of different ways, and sometimes being open to the application of your skill set in a similar or parallel field may make sense. \n\n You with me here? \n\n I could be completely wrong, but thanks for reading anyway. Let me know if you liked this one. \n\n Happy Christmas and Merry Hanukkah. \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Watch my recent YouTube video Or... Watch my recent Podcast ​\n\n ​",

And I had no cavities, so that was pretty cool. \n\n The online education industry still blows my mind sometimes. \n\n Nearly anyone who has acquired any niche skill has the capability to share their story on social media and find people who are willing to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to learn from them. \n\n With the boom of short-form content, it’s never been easier to start making minute-long videos from your iPhone, and *boom* now you have a potential seven-figure business. \n\n This is the situation for every single one of my clients. \n\n We’ve been working with a client who buys small local businesses. \n\n It’s a much more complicated process than I’ll make it sound here, but basically, he has a system that allows anyone with a stable income and some money to invest to acquire a “boomer” business that cashflows around 6-figs per year right off the bat. \n\n The process of finding a type of business that’s a good buy is the most complicated part, but once an acquisition is complete, he can operate the business remotely and only spend about an hour per week on each business, making sure nothing catches on fire. \n\n He started making content on social media, and just months later, we’re doing multi-six-figure months, and he’s got dozens of successful students. \n\n There’s no real lesson here today, but I just wanted to make it clear how simple it can be to launch and scale an online education company. \n\n I’ve got something coming for you soon if you’re someone who is building this type of business or something similar, so be on the lookout for my emails over the next few weeks. \n\n Let’s hit the gas and build a life in 2024 where you don’t have to “look forward to the Holidays” because your whole life feels like a Holiday :) \n\n Thanks for reading my words today.

    "body": "I’ve been in the online marketing space for about three years now. \n\n Throughout this time, I’ve met a lot of people who were trying to “make it” as entrepreneurs. Some completely failed, some stagnated, and others have been on par with the same level of success I’ve seen or have found financial success quicker than me. \n\n Obviously, there are unicorns, but for the most part, intelligence doesn’t seem to play a huge role as long a baseline level of competence is established. \n\n It’s similar to being a professional athlete – at the highest levels, everyone is a “freak” athlete. It’s the minimum standard, and generally, the intangibles are what separates the good from the great. \n\n Here are a few of the less tangible traits I see in my more successful friends (which those who stagnate or fail seem to lack): \n\n 1. Ingenuity & craftiness: In the world of entrepreneurship, rules are meant to be broken, loopholes are meant to be found, and the lines between what works and what doesn’t are blurred. \n\n There’s a proclaimed “right way” to find success, and then there's the way that actually works for you. \n\n Creativity and persistence will (sometimes) take you much further than blindly following a “proven system” that other people tell you to. \n\n 2. Discipline & the ability to create order in chaos: Freedom causes most people to lose their minds. When you’re accustomed to being told what to do, what to think, and where to be, having to tell yourself those things is a big adjustment. \n\n Build a system for yourself that works for you. Again, it doesn’t have to be what other people are doing as long as it puts you in an environment and mental space that allows you to do what you need to do. \n\n 3. Comfortable with the unknown: Eventually, you come to the realization that no matter how much you plan, no matter how hard you try, and no matter how badly you want something to happen, you are not in complete control of the outcome. \n\n Certainty makes us feel safe. And if you’re too attached to that feeling of safety, go get a desk job and a 401k. Or prepare to always have a voice in the back of your head that thinks everything is gonna crumble at any given moment. \n\n Bonus trait 4 - The gut feeling paradox: There’s a balance between listening to signs from the universe that tell you that you need to make a change versus jumping from one shiny object to the next. \n\n Sometimes, when things don’t feel right, it’s a sign that you need to make a change. \n\n Other times, when things don’t feel right, it’s a sign that you’re on the cusp of something great if you can power through that feeling. \n\n This is a constant game. I don’t have any advice on how to navigate it because truthfully, I don’t know if anyone does. \n\n I guess that brings us back to trait #3, huh? \n\n Alrighty, hope you liked this one. Keep pushing these next few days and build momentum going into 2024. \n\n Happy hump day, let me know if you read this whole thing <3 \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. If you still haven’t watched my recent YouTube video, go here plz. ​ \n\n ​",

Simple. \n\n Hope you enjoyed my anti-self-improvement turned self-improvement email. \n\n Love ya, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

Shit makes me nervous. \n\n I immediately started thinking of excuses I could come up with to get out of it. \n\n Maybe I’ll plan a trip that weekend so that I have a legitimate reason to say no. \n\n Or perhaps I’ll say my dog ate my computer and I can’t make the PowerPoint presentation. Or maybe I’ll start licking door handles and kissing homeless people so I can be sick that day. \n\n Ugh. \n\n As my conscious thoughts run through a variety of excuses, I have a feeling in my stomach that tells me that I have to say yes. \n\n This is a common occurrence among the things we don't want to do. \n\n It can be as simple as when someone invites you to dinner, and you initially try to say no, but somehow you get roped into going. \n\n Then you end up having a good time, and you're glad you went. \n\n But our ego wants to protect us. It wants to talk us out of putting ourselves in any position where there’s an opportunity to look like a fool or be challenged in any way. \n\n I could get up there, start my presentation, and forget how to pronounce my own name and lose my ability to speak english. \n\n Imagine I do the whole thing in Spanish and no one understands it. \n\n But in reality — detached from the fragile, overbearing ego that’s inside of all of us, I know that it’s an experience that’ll be good for character development in the movie that I star in inside my own head. \n\n And the last email I wrote to you was literally about how getting over “the flinch” is all you need to be successful. \n\n So that’d be extremely hypocritical of me to bitch out because I’m nervous. \n\n If there’s one thing I want you to take away from my rant today, it’s this: \n\n You have conscious thoughts that your ego feeds you as a protection mechanism. \n\n And then you have your gut feeling. \n\n Learn to decipher the difference between the two when you’re making a decision, and it might lead you to experiences that are necessary for your development. \n\n Or you’ll embarrass yourself and never listen to me again. \n\n Happy New Year, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

This one’s simple, so I won’t spend too much time here. \n\n - Clear idea client avatar \n\n We’ve become quite strict on the type of business for which we can provide the best work. \n\n If a prospect comes to us wanting a funnel, webinar, VSL, or email list management, yet they have little traffic and a minimal email list, we do not pitch them. \n\n We usually refer them to a friend who can help them with their organic content or simply give them pointers on how to build their audience. \n\n They sometimes end up coming back months later after they’ve taken the steps we gave them on the call. \n\n - Personal brand & network \n\n If you go to my Twitter or TikTok, there is proof that I am a real human doing real things. It’s also clear that I’m not another self-proclaimed “expert agency owner” who regurgitates the same three talking points. \n\n This makes it so people develop a bit of a relationship with me and my idealogy before we ever get on the phone. \n\n I’m telling you all this in order to show you that many things you may think you need to find success are often a facade. \n\n Whether you run an agency or a completely different type of business, your success often boils down to a few key factors. \n\n Once you understand what those factors are, double down on them rather than wasting time trying to find the next magic pill that will carry you to the promised land. \n\n Repeat successful actions, and success becomes inevitable. \n\n Let me know if you liked this one, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I’m making another YouTube video this week. Reply and let me know if there’s anything you’d like me to talk about in my next video, and click here to watch my most recent video. ​ \n\n ​",

You’re doing it right. \n\n But if you’re like me – and like most people, you know in your core that you’re not even scratching the surface of your potential. \n\n Even if things are good. \n\n Hell, that’s honestly more dangerous. You get some money, a fun lifestyle, a girl or 10… it’s easy to throw in the towel and feel like you’ve won. \n\n And maybe you have won by most people’s standards. \n\n But you know that it’s not complete. It’s not even close. \n\n That doesn’t sit right with you. So even though you’re “living the dream,” that voice in your head doesn’t go away. \n\n It’s the same voice you heard when you felt compelled to start a business or make any life-altering change. \n\n It eats you up silently.\nYou suppress it and tell yourself false narratives and stories in an attempt to remove its power. \n\n Perhaps it works temporarily. \n\n But on a long enough time horizon, you just can’t seem to shake it. \n\n Eventually, you’ll be left at a crossroads where you have to decide whether or not you’re going to quench those urges and step into the reality that you know is possible for you. \n\n Or continuously attempt to fool yourself and risk sabotaging your life in the process. \n\n After all, the only way to ensure that you’re rarely disappointed is to do your best. \n\n As long as you do that, there will never be “what ifs.” \n\n Sure, things won’t always go your way. But you’ll sleep knowing you did everything in your power with the resources you had on hand. \n\n You’ll find peace in the fact that you actually fucking tried. \n\n You get one shot at this. Don’t half-ass it. \n\n Alright even motivation, can we stop saying “Happy New Year” now? \n\n It’s the 4th. Nobody was saying Merry Christmas on NYE. \n\n I hope this made you feel some fire in your soul if you made it all the way down here, and if it did, you’ll probably like this too. ​ \n\n Happy 4th day of the new year, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

Learn how to provide a service or build a product that solves a problem for other people. \n\n 2. Find a mechanism to get clients or customers. \n\n That’s it. \n\n Repeat that process a bunch of times, and then you no longer have to look at price tags. \n\n I’ve grown to believe that you cannot develop into the highest version of yourself until you’re in complete abundance financially. \n\n When you have to worry about menial expenses and constantly chase cash, it distorts your lens of reality. \n\n Your broke “life coach” has two motives. First, they need to keep you as a client. Second, they want to help you just enough but not too much so that you’re “fixed” and can leave. \n\n Sorry, I’m rambling here. \n\n Last thing I’ll share today: \n\n I’m opening up a small consulting group exclusively for people on this email list. \n\n It’ll be fairly expensive and isn’t for complete beginners. \n\n But it should be pretty dope and “VaLuAble” for people who are in the online coaching space, run agencies, or simply want to chat with me on a more intimate basis (no homo). \n\n If you’re interested, just reply to this email and let me know so that I can have Russian hackers send you a phishing link and steal your credit card info. \n\n I know this one was a bit all over the place, so thanks for sticking with me {{ subscriber.first_name }}. \n\n Happy Monday, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I’ve condensed my best tweets into my “highlights” section if wanna check them out here. ​ \n\n There’s some gold in there. But also a lot of nonsense and stuff that I’ll probably cringe at in 3 months. Such is life! \n\n Okay, bye love u. \n\n ​",

Absolute banger. \n\n Anyway, I've got a good one for you today (I think). \n\n I’ve never publicly shared a ton about the ins and outs of how we’re scaling our clients' info-product businesses because it’s always felt a bit boring. \n\n Honestly, scaling a coaching program or course business to $500k/mo+ is shockingly simple. \n\n I know that may sound like a crazy amount of money, but here are some of the main things I’ve learned about how we got there *by accident.* \n\n - Traffic solves all. You can have the best offer in the world, pay me $20k to build out your funnels, and hire Jordan Belfort as your closer. But none of it will matter if you don’t have eyeballs. \n\n - If you can’t crack organic content, you should probably get a 9-5. Seriously. If you have something to sell and you’re unable to get attention on the internet in 2024, you should be an accountant instead. The entire multi-7-figure business I’m writing about was built off of short-form content. \n\n - Do not forget to build your plane while you’re flying it. Because these businesses scale so fast, there’s a lot of added complexity to the product and fulfillment side. If you neglect the customer experience, you will crash and burn on a long enough time horizon. \n\n - Systems only matter at scale. We neglected a lot of the optimizations and organizational aspects of the business until we were already making multi-6-figs per month. Until then, we only focused on more traffic, more webinar registrants, and more booked calls. \n\n - There is no secret sauce. I can’t emphasize this enough: Build offer, get attention. Build offer, get attention. Build offer, get attention. Fix everything else later. The degree to which you can scale is dependent on your ability to consistently bring more people into your funnel who know, like, and trust you. \n\n Enough writing for today. \n\n I hope this helped you in some way, and if it didn’t, thanks for wasting some time with me. \n\n By the way, there were a lot more people than I anticipated who replied to my email yesterday about the consulting group that I’m opening up. \n\n I’m still mapping out the details in my head, but I’ll have more info for you soon. \n\n Thanks for chatting with me today. \n\n Talk soon, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "Sometimes I get lazy. \n\n I procrastinate. \n\n Tasks that should take 3 minutes to complete end up taking weeks because I put them off for so long. \n\n On the contrary, I’ve had periods where I’m super locked in and productive. \n\n After I dropped out of college, I spent the following 3 months in Mexico. \n\n I’d wake up early every morning, hit the gym, bike home, take sales calls, spam more prospects, check in with my clients, write copy, and make content. \n\n There was no room to be lazy. \n\n If I skipped one thing, everything else would fall apart. \n\n The whole “time freedom” fantasy is a bit of a trap. \n\n Not having any obligations sounds great in theory, but if you don’t have the discipline to fill your time with productive activities that help you generate momentum, you’ll fail. \n\n Think about these three instances: \n\n Guy quits his job. \n\n Kid drops out of school. \n\n Girl breaks up with guy. \n\n Each of these usually acts as a catalyst for a big life change – either positive or negative. \n\n All the time and energy that was spent working, studying, or reminding your girlfriend to drink water is now freed up. \n\n Some people replace those things with a structured routine, and others don’t. \n\n Most cannot handle freedom. \n\n But obviously, this is all paradoxical because too much structure makes you a dork, and too much freedom makes you lazy. \n\n Here’s what reminded me of this concept: \n\n Last night, I ordered a cheesesteak on Uber Eats. \n\n This isn’t just any cheesesteak. \n\n Imagine God himself transmutes into a hard-working (likely Mexican or Cuban) man who sets up a ghost kitchen on Uber Eats called “Chef Pepper.” \n\n As I waited for Liana to weave through traffic on her motorbike to deliver my order, I remembered that the last thing on my long to-do list for the day was to make a YouTube video. \n\n I’d already had a busy and productive day, so why not see if I could knock out a video in the 10 minutes that I’m waiting here? \n\n I set up my iPhone camera and started yapping. \n\n 7 minutes and 19 seconds later, I had a semi-coherent ramble that I had enough confidence in to upload on the World Wide Web. \n\n ​ (you can watch it here btw) ​ \n\n Funny how that works, huh? \n\n I’d procrastinated for 27 days since making my last video, but once I entered a race against a cheesesteak, I was able to knock it out in less than 10 minutes. \n\n Pressure spurs you into action. If you’re not competing, you’re likely stalling. \n\n Even if it means you have to find creative ways to jumpstart your productivity. \n\n Happy hump day, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Don’t forget about my YT video ​ \n\n P.P.S. I’ll be opening consulting spots in one of my next few emails. Keep an eye out if you don’t want to miss it (thanks for your patience). \n\n ​",

I’d sell anything I could to my audience. I’d find ways to help my friends in their businesses. \n\n And because I’d be on a real-life clock against time, I know I’d be absolutely relentless. \n\n Take a second now to think about what you’d do in this situation. \n\n Who can you go to for help? \n\n What’s the easiest way you can make an extra $10k? \n\n What value can you provide to other people? \n\n When you picture yourself in this predicament, you may realize that the solutions you come up with could be implemented right now. \n\n If you feel like you’re stuck or you’ve stalled out at a certain income threshold, odds are you’re just not being resourceful enough. \n\n Maybe you’re a bit too comfortable, and although you tell yourself you want to progress, your desire doesn’t outweigh the pain of change. \n\n This leaves you with a few options: \n\n 1. Do nothing and stay in this constant state of unease where your actions don’t meet your desired reality. \n\n 2. Do nothing and accept that you are comfortable where you are, even if you’re selling yourself short. \n\n 3. Act like you just donated your livelihood to a stripper and get back to work with a newfound ferocity. \n\n The choice is yours – Just some food for thought. \n\n Talk to you tomorrow {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Ben. \n\n P.S. Watch my recent YouTube video here. ​\n\n ​",

And then sometimes realizes that he didn’t actually want it once he has it. But at least he knows now. \n\n To me, it’s at the point where you’ve tried everything and quenched the majority of the desires that you actually have the perspective to say – \n\n “Okay, here’s the way I want to live the rest of my life.” \n\n Adults vaping has to be one of the most cringe things I’ve ever observed. \n\n Sorry to get sidetracked here, but I just saw a woman who looks like her name is Susan tilt her head back and blow a fat cloud into the air as if she’s smoking hookah at a club. \n\n I guess I’m an adult too, and I do occasionally vape, but I don’t act like I’m Rick Ross in a sea of large women while sitting at the coffee shop. \n\n And I’m not a 30-something-year-old woman. \n\n I know today's email has been all over the place, but I’m doing this to ensure you that my list will not become an “escape the matrix, gain remote freedom” sausage fest now that I’ve opened consulting. \n\n I frankly do not care if you join, but it’s here if you want it :) ​\n\n Gonna go smack this vape out of Susan's hand. \n\n Talk tomorrow, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. If you’re newer here and were hoping for super in-depth information about how I run my agency and how we scale our clients' offers to half a million per month, this might not be for you. \n\n Every now and then, I’ll give specific business advice, but most of these emails are little rants and observations I find interesting. \n\n Too many people become carbon copies of big gurus when they take the “give value” approach, and I never want to be one of them. \n\n Stick around if you’d like, and maybe you’ll enjoy it <3 \n\n ​",

Sure, the terminally ill people are likely gonna die soon anyway, but that’s a lot of blood on your hands. \n\n This is the way I see the majority of the info products on the market. \n\n Most people will fail. \n\n As an education business scales, a few things happen that start the degradation of their client success rate. \n\n First, they start selling to beginners and idiots. \n\n Oftentimes, if you want to get to $300k/month+, this is the only way to do it (although there are anomalies). \n\n And naturally, when the quality of your customer decreases, so does the effectiveness of your product. \n\n They buy courses and never open them. They ask for a refund or chargeback after doing 1% of the work. \n\n These are the terminally ill. They were never gonna make it anyway. And you’re better at spending their money than they are, right? \n\n The second reason success rates decline is because it’s fucking difficult to manage hundreds (or thousands) of customers. \n\n Many won’t get the support they need unless they proactively seek it out. \n\n Plus in some situations, teaching a large batch of people the same methods to start a business can make those methods less successful. \n\n Does this make selling info products immoral or evil? \n\n Here’s the flip side: \n\n Let’s say 100 people buy a course that teaches them how to start a marketing agency. \n\n 95 people give up after a few months and lose the few hundred or few thousand dollars they’d spent on the course. \n\n But 5 people actually commit to building this business. \n\n 6 months to a year later, they’ve completely changed their lives. They’ve quit their 9-5s, dropped out of college, and paid off their parents' medical bills. \n\n Fast forward a few years, and one of them has amassed millions of dollars. \n\n That person now employs a dozen people, supports their family, and inspires thousands of others online. \n\n So, was that worth it? \n\n Sure, a little blood was spilled, but think about all the good that came out of it. \n\n And after all, who are we to be judges of morality? \n\n If you read this far, hit reply and let me know what you think. \n\n Two last things for you: \n\n 1. Enrollment for my 1-on-1 & small group consulting is closing in a few days. \n\n ​ Go here to apply before the deadline on Sunday. ​\n\n 2. Internet Kids clothing is back. \n\n ​ Check it out here. ​ \n\n Good chat today my friend, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

I pay about $20k per year to be in the group. \n\n He hosts a quarterly mastermind at his house in Miami, where he’ll have a handful of speakers talk about a variety of topics and give a presentation of his own. \n\n If you were reading my emails earlier this month, you may remember me saying that he invited me to speak. \n\n I gave my presentation this morning. \n\n Here are some things that I found interesting from giving my own talk and some of the other speakers today: \n\n - Most of the time, you’ll be glad you said “yes” to doing things you initially felt resistance towards. \n\n Whether it’s a business opportunity, speaking at an event, or saying yes to the voice in your head that tells you to go up to the pretty girl. \n\n The more you can overcome that resistance, the more it loses its power, and you’ll laugh that you were ever nervous. \n\n - You do not need to be back against the wall to find motivation. You need to manufacture internal dialogue that tells you to make more money. \n\n It’s easy to be inspired when you have no other options. But as you find success, you need to move out of “survival mode,” and your vision needs to get bigger. \n\n Set goals and envision a lifestyle that gives you a reason to make more money – especially if you have enough money to live comfortably for the next 3 years sitting in your checking account. \n\n - Your current reality is a lagging indicator of your previous actions and habits. \n\n The future version of you 6 months – 1 year – and 10 years down the line is the result of what you do today. \n\n Figure out what you want that future to look like and reverse engineer the daily actions you need to take to make it inevitable. \n\n The three lessons above may sound basic or elementary to you, but most of the time, we don’t need revolutionary new advice. \n\n We need to be reminded of the fundamental elements that lead to success and we need to actually practice them. \n\n These masterminds always remind me how small I’m playing and how much further I have to go. \n\n If you feel an equal need to get substantially richer, the application for my 1-on-1 and small group consulting is closing tomorrow. \n\n No pressure and no fake scarcity, but this is one of your last chances to apply before our calls start on Monday. \n\n ​ Go here now to learn about The Bader Group. ​ \n\n I’m exhausted so apologies for the lack of personality in this one, but hope you liked it. \n\n Need moor monies, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

Let me know if you read this one :) \n\n ​",

We’ll make a bunch of future all-stars and live vicariously through them as I grow old and start taking TRTs so I can keep up with my much younger model wife. \n\n Hahaha. \n\n Speaking of girls, I’ve been reflecting on some things I’ve learned about dating recently. \n\n First, women are amazing. \n\n Nearly every girl I meet is pleasant to be around and has their own unique vibe (if they’re comfortable enough to show that side of themself to you). \n\n Don’t listen to the losers who tell you Western women are ruined. \n\n Sure, not every girl you meet is gonna be a potential wife, and that’s okay. \n\n Understanding this allows you to appreciate them for who they are and simply have fun. \n\n It also gives you a more complete perspective on what qualities you look for in someone you would take more seriously and potentially date. \n\n Next, take it slowwwwwww. \n\n If you scroll through TikTok, you’ll see “dating coaches” say that you need to commit to someone within 1-3 months. \n\n This is absolutely crazy in my opinion. Normalize 6-12 month talking stages. Sometimes longer. \n\n Seriously. \n\n It takes time to get to know someone. There are many things you’ll learn about them that will only come out over time. \n\n Rushing into a relationship is a surefire way that it’ll go up in flames. \n\n And no, this isn’t just a way to keep your freedom and avoid exclusivity. \n\n It ensures that you guys actually know each other before you put a label on it. Because that label will only complicate things. \n\n Little fights turn into UFC matches (not physically, I hope) and if the foundation of the relationship isn’t rock solid, it’ll collapse. \n\n Last thing and most important one. \n\n If you’re a girl reading this, you should stop here. I’m sorry it has to be this way, but it does. \n\n The solution to 99% of your “girl problems” is solved by having… \n\n options. \n\n Lots of them. 3 Barbies, 2 Cinderellas, a Tinekerbell, and maybe a Harley Quinn or 3. \n\n This sounds bad when I say it out loud like this, but I’m doing so for a reason: \n\n Detachment. \n\n Neediness has to be the #1 turn-off for women. And when she’s your only option, she can feel it. \n\n Women are intuitive little creatures. They’re actually harder to deceive than men. \n\n When you’re someone who truly has options, you care less about losing one of them, and it changes your entire demeanor. \n\n You’re not a dancing monkey trying to impress her. You’re you. \n\n They’ll never admit it, but they like a man with options. \n\n Crucify me. But I’m right. \n\n Ok, enough for today. Lmk if you liked my takes on this topic and want to hear more. \n\n Take a pretty model on a date tonight, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. One of my subscribers suggested I take my old emails and basically turn them into a little blog. Any suggestions or ideas on how to do this (platforms, organization, etc.)? \n\n ​",

Or coffee shops? Merging onto a highway? \n\n It’s like their systems get overloaded, and they revert to monkey brains, where they just start making sounds and looking for bananas. \n\n Anyway, let’s talk about more important things. \n\n Imagine you’re building yourself a car. \n\n You get all the parts you need and spend countless hours configuring your vehicle. \n\n Finally, you’re ready to hit the road. \n\n You hop in and start driving. \n\n At first, it’s great. You’re excited to finally enjoy the fruits of your labor. \n\n But after a few hundred miles, the engine starts making a strange noise. \n\n You pull over and pop the hood. \n\n It’s a minor problem, and you know exactly what you need to do to fix it. \n\n You close the hood and tell yourself you’ll fix it later. \n\n As you continue driving, you see another car and are immediately enamored. \n\n “That’s the kind of car I want,” you think to yourself. \n\n When you get home, you order parts and set out to build it. \n\n Over the next few months, you start neglecting car #1, and the minor problem with the engine has turned into a much bigger issue. \n\n Instead of fixing it, you spend all your time building a new car. \n\n And finally, once your “perfect” car is ready, you hit the road. And the cycle continues. You see a new car you like better, neglect your own, and start all over. \n\n See where I’m going with this? \n\n This is how many of us treat our businesses, relationships, and a variety of other endeavors. \n\n We spend so much time laying the foundation for what could be something special. \n\n But once the novelty wears off and we realize the constant maintenance that’s necessary for continuous progression, we start looking for the \"new thing.\" \n\n Instead of putting our feet on the gas and maximizing what’s in front of us, we let what we’ve built deteriorate so that we can have an excuse to start all over. \n\n It’s a familiar comfort. It allows for the illusion of productivity. But it keeps you stuck. \n\n And don’t you want to find out how far you can go if you can resist the urge to turn your head every time you see a new girl in a red dress? \n\n Water your own plants. Today, tomorrow, and especially in 6 months when it’s no longer as exciting. \n\n Thx for reading, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

Action. Action. \n\n That’s it. Don’t be stupid. \n\n This email is especially simple to prove to you that I am no smarter than you. \n\n All of my friends are relatively rich. \n\n And all of my friends are likey no smarter than you either. \n\n Do not be dumb. Get rich. It’s easy. \n\n Enough motivation for today. \n\n Gonna go do things that will make me money! \n\n I recommend you do the same :) \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

They lift your energy and make you feel better about yourself. \n\n Recently, I’ve noticed that people generally perceive me quite positively. \n\n I’ll get random invites to things, girls will pursue me to an extent, service workers love me, and I have absolutely amazing friends in my life. \n\n I’m not saying this to gloat here. \n\n I’ve had times in my life where it feels like I’ve been perceived as the exact opposite of what I just described above. \n\n If I had to boil down what’s changed for me into one word, it’d be this: \n\n Expression. \n\n People like it when they can be themselves. They like it when they know they’re not gonna be judged or used for some ulterior motive. \n\n And the easiest way to get people into this state is to be in it yourself. \n\n When you’re truly you – you say what you want, you’re honest, you’re observant… it creates this genuine look in your eyes and your smile. \n\n People can just sense it. \n\n But this is only developed when you cultivate enough respect for yourself to stop suppressing who you really are. \n\n So let me remind you: \n\n You are uniquely you. \n\n You’ve overcome every hurdle you’ve encountered. \n\n You’ve relied on yourself in times of hardship and uncertainty. \n\n And you got yourself through it. \n\n There's a voice inside you that knows the way. \n\n That trusts you fully.\nThat accepts you for who you are. \n\n You owe it to that voice to bring it to life. \n\n And when you do – you deserve the world. \n\n Be you, {{ subscriber.first_name }}. \n\n Love ya, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

I genuinely think he’s the happiest person I know. \n\n Papi always has a smile on his face and just radiates energy that lets you know he’s grateful to be alive. \n\n Yesterday in the elevator I told him I just went to the gym (fui al gimnasio) and was about to get work done (voy a trabajo). \n\n In English he said, “Life is working.” \n\n Papi probably knows a total of 100 words in the English dictionary, but those three together can be quite powerful. \n\n I recently realized that I’d developed a bad habit. \n\n No matter how great things are, I’m constantly pondering every detail of my life – even the things I already understand and have no reason to be stressing about. \n\n “How am I gonna make more money?” \n\n “How is this relationship gonna work out?” \n\n “Why don’t I feel the way I anticipated when I envisioned the lifestyle I’m living now?” \n\n “What do I need to change?” \n\n All I’m doing as I think about these things is reinforcing the idea that there is some future Utopia that I don’t have access to right now. \n\n No bueno. \n\n Most of us need to think less and do more. \n\n You can analyze and reflect once you reach the top of the mountain. \n\n But until then, \n\n Feet on gas. \n\n Head down. \n\n Quiet mind. \n\n Life is working. \n\n Thanks for reading - glad to be back. \n\n Talk soon, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "I saw my ex today. \n\n She’s not really my ex because I never asked her to be my girlfriend, but nonetheless, we shared a lot of time together and many amazing memories. \n\n Seeing her from across the restaurant that we used to go to together was strange. \n\n We waved and briefly said hello as she walked by on her way out. \n\n I got back from a 4-day bender in New York yesterday. \n\n We didn’t do much other than go to dinner and the club with the 20 girls (literally) that we brought, but it was fun for obvious reasons. \n\n My sincere apologies for neglecting you over the last two weeks. \n\n Over the last 6 months, my lifestyle has taken a complete 180. \n\n I barely went out during the first 10 months I lived in Miami. \n\n While I had a circle of a few close friends, I was never the one to initiate the plans or make an effort to find exciting things to do. \n\n After a while, it started feeling like I wasn’t my own person. \n\n I became an extension of my friend group, who lacked his own interests, hobbies, and network. \n\n And most of my nights were spent sitting at my desk with a lit candle and some music in the background, clicking buttons on my computer. \n\n Now, nights like this are rare, and I have an added appreciation for them. \n\n While the work I did during the time when I lacked a social life laid the groundwork for us getting to 6 figure months with my agency, life feels a lot fuller now. \n\n I’m sure there will be a time when I go back to being a bit more of a hobbit, but this work-hard, play-hard lifestyle is much more enjoyable for my current stage. \n\n Here are some of the things I did that allowed me to build a fun social life while continuing to grow my business: \n\n 1. Delegation \n\n I sent a $30,000 wire to a team member/friend today. \n\n Bringing him on was one of the best decisions I’ve made. \n\n It’s made it much easier for me, freed up my time, and the quality of work we’re able to deliver has improved. \n\n After all, money is just a number on a screen until you put it to use. \n\n If you’re unwilling to sacrifice some margin, have fun being trapped at your desk all day. \n\n 2. Branching out \n\n I went out of my way to make new friends and build a bigger network in Miami. \n\n Once I met one or two well-connected people, it created a snowball effect in my social life. \n\n Outside of just my network, I started to “branch out” by taking up new hobbies, like boxing and tennis. \n\n Finding new interests and hobbies like this helped me reinvent my perception of myself. \n\n This helped reshape my identity and made me feel like I had more exciting things going on in my life. \n\n 3. Social media \n\n If you go look at my Instagram toward the end of July, you can see a shift occur. \n\n Even my facial expression and demeanor appear more confident in more recent photos. \n\n I know it may sound superficial, but putting effort into making a better-looking Instagram and posting consistently on TikTok has opened so many doors and brought me a world of connections. \n\n These three things helped me enter a version of myself that I couldn’t access previously. \n\n My lifestyle is exactly the way I envisioned it when I pictured living in Miami. \n\n Although this is just a “side quest” to the main mission (getting disgustingly rich), it’s brought me a lot of clarity and taught me lessons that I couldn’t have learned at my desk. \n\n Cheers to life-maxxing. \n\n Call your ex today, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Reply if you read this whole thing and happy early Valentines Day baby <3 \n\n ​",

    "body": "Yesterday, I saw a clip of Johnny Manziel talking about how depressed he was during his first couple of years playing in the NFL. \n\n He said Lebron, who was his childhood hero, would call him a few times a week to hang out, and he’d decline because he didn’t want to leave the house. \n\n Looking at this from the outside in, here’s what I gather: \n\n Once you begin to get the things you want, you gradually internalize that they won’t change anything. \n\n By “things you want,” I don't just mean material items or lifestyle, but also your outward perception. \n\n You can get all the praise, respect, and validation. \n\n You can be the guy other dudes envy and girls want to be with. \n\n This comes with a lot of pressure, which can break you if your self-image isn’t rock solid. \n\n The expectations of others start to weigh on you, and your standards rise to a level that takes a lot to maintain. \n\n If you feel undeserving, you manifest that idea into reality. \n\n Your motivation dwindles, you lack discipline, and you start to let your problems add up. \n\n “You can’t outperform your self-image.” \n\n The weight of the contrast between how others perceive you versus how you perceive yourself causes you to crumble. \n\n That make sense? \n\n Anyway, a guy in front of me at this coffee shop is reading the book “7 Habits Of Highly Effective People.” \n\n He’s mouthing the words as he reads, which I find interesting. \n\n When I walked in to order my coffee, the barista told me she liked my hoodie and replied, “Ben 10” when I told her my name was Ben. \n\n I found that endearing, so I gave her the Van Cleef bracelet off my wrist. \n\n One time, I sat next to Johnny Manziel at dinner (I think I told you about that in an email months ago). \n\n Not long after, he DM’d the girl I was with that night. \n\n Shooters shoot, I guess. \n\n Last thing – Yesterday, I was journaling and asked myself, “What would make your life better than it is right now?” \n\n It was easy to come up with an answer to that question, and I found it interesting that my answer had little to do with more money or anything flashy. \n\n I encourage you to ask yourself the same thing when you have 20 min today. \n\n Thanks for reading, and hope you enjoyed, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

Enjoy 2024” \n\n “You are loved!” \n\n “Smile! Today’s a great day” \n\n Outside the quotes, a combination of people likely identify as “creatives” are promoting their work. \n\n “Need graphics? DM me on Instagram! @arthoe6969” \n\n There are over 100 sticky notes and “business” cards on here. \n\n Plus a lost cat flyer in the top right corner. \n\n In the middle, nearly covered up by the self-love propaganda, there’s a note that says, “Be here now.” \n\n Probably a lesson in there. \n\n Being present is something that’s a constant battle for me. \n\n Two summers ago, I was on a beach in Greece, watching the sunset with a bunch of friends. \n\n Instead of admiring the view, I was stuck in my head, stressing over whatever was happening in my business then. \n\n I remember looking around at my friends and wondering if they were thinking about something else too, or if I was just broken. \n\n Last night, a client of ours ran a webinar (where we made over $100k) and was asked the question: \n\n “How do you deal with stress as an entrepreneur?” \n\n He said, “I don’t… Nothing that I do is stressful,” and moved on to the next question. \n\n As simple as this answer was, I found it interesting. \n\n What you give your attention to grows. \n\n The people who wrote these stupid little quotes on the board in front of me are probably unhappy. \n\n They’re so obsessed with positive affirmations – and fearful of anxiety, that they bring their fears to fruition. \n\n The “self-love” reminders attempt to convince themselves that they don’t hate themselves. \n\n A happy person doesn’t need a reminder to be happy. They just are. \n\n It’s almost like when you’re overly conscious about improving your mental health, it has an inverse effect. \n\n Dictating how you feel can be as simple as making a decision. \n\n Simply decide not to stress over something, stop giving it power, and it goes away. \n\n When my client on the webinar was asked that question, it was like the idea of stress didn’t even exist in his world… he was almost confused. \n\n And, after all, worrying and over-analyzing do nothing but exacerbate the problem. \n\n Maybe the answer is to bE hEre noW! \n\n Corny but true. \n\n I’m gonna start meditating. \n\n Hope you and your Spotify shuffle get along today, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "Happy Friday {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n I wrote this one yesterday and forgot to send it once I got to my hotel, so I am sending it now. \n\n Enjoy <3 \n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n I’m on a flight to LA right now. \n\n I land in about 30 minutes and have spent the last 4 hours finding clever ways to procrastinate writing this email. \n\n It started with the usual scroll through social media, but that can only last so long. \n\n So I got creative. I took a personality quiz, changed my return flight, got ahead on some work, and did enough research on LA restaurants that I could write one of those gay “Top 10 MUST TRY spots in LA” blog posts. \n\n Just so you know, I’m in seat 1A. There’s no reason for me to tell you this, but I figured I’d tell you anyway. \n\n Let’s talk about money and identity. \n\n When I first started making some money a few years ago, my mental well-being became entirely reliant on my monthly income. \n\n When I’d hit a new all-time high, I’d be over the moon. \n\n I was more confident, I spoke with conviction, and I generally felt and acted much more positively. \n\n Conversely, when my monthly income stagnated or regressed, I lost all confidence and was in a constant state of panic. \n\n When I’d talk to people, I wasn’t really there. I was physically there, but my mind would drift, drowning out the person who was talking with my own thoughts. \n\n These times were interesting. \n\n This fight-or-flight mode wasn’t pleasant, but I think it helped me progress quicker. \n\n All I thought about was business. \n\n Recently, it’s been the opposite. I honestly don’t know if it’s been a good or bad month for the agency numbers-wise. \n\n We did help a client make $400k in 4 days recently which was pretty cool. \n\n He paid us our commission in crypto, so I threw all that money into a meme coin. \n\n Back to the main point - I’ve been the opposite of “locked in” recently. \n\n Locked out? \n\n Opened in? \n\n Not sure of the correct term. \n\n Everyone loves to act like they’re always working so hard. \n\n This may cause you to feel like you constantly need to be at war, as it did for me. \n\n It also meant my self-image was tied to my income. \n\n While I think that can be a good thing to an extent, it’s a hamster wheel that no amount of money can get you off of. \n\n Sure, if you’re not growing, you’re dying — but growth can come in many forms. \n\n It doesn’t always mean you’re doubling your monthly income or spending 12 hours a day at your desk. \n\n Maybe it means you’re traveling more, building deeper relationships, beating your friend Jimmy in 2K, etc. \n\n Simply side questing. \n\n And know there will be a time when you need to lock back in. \n\n You can’t just coast forever — but sometimes, momentary coasting can help you return to work with an added excitement. \n\n Or at least that’s what I’m telling myself. \n\n I'm about to land and gotta wrap this up, but there is one last thing I want to add… \n\n *Everything I just said does not apply to you if you don’t have enough money to fulfill the immediate image that pops into your head when you think about having money. \n\n For me, that image is the exact life I’m living now. \n\n I imagine for me to find the motivation to push beyond where I’m at now, that vision must evolve. \n\n Ok, I just landed. Gotta go. Missed you, let me know if this one made sense to you. \n\n Bye from 1A, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "I just got home from sparring with my boxing coach. \n\n We were going pretty light, though he caught me in the head a few times. \n\n Maybe I’m a weirdo, but it feels really good to get hit in the face. \n\n We’ll be trading punches, somewhat messing around until boom… \n\n I’ll move the wrong way and position my face perfectly into his jab. \n\n There’s this feeling of aliveness that comes after that moment. \n\n It’s like a signal goes through my brain that says, “Okay, time to lock in,” while I simultaneously realize that I’m not going to die. \n\n Immediately after, I enter a new state where I’m much more free-flowing, and my energy is revitalized. \n\n I’m ready to attack because once that first punch connects with my nose, I’m no longer scared of it. \n\n I know I’m gonna be okay no matter what. \n\n There’s an equally powerful lesson in there that we can extrapolate to life. \n\n Sometimes, you have to let yourself get rocked. \n\n When you’re comfortable at a certain income level or have enough money in the bank to where you wouldn't have to work for the next couple of years… \n\n You have to punch yourself. \n\n You’re trying to live comfortably and ignore the possibility that reality could rock you with a right hook if you’re too slow. \n\n Over the last few months, I completed the vision that I’d been aiming at for a while. \n\n My business reached six-figure months, I bought my dream car, my social life was thriving, and I was living in the exact movie that I used to dream of. \n\n After a few months of fun, my anxiety started to increase. \n\n I’m not growing. I’m not evolving or working towards anything. \n\n And admittedly, I started to take my foot off the gas. \n\n This life I aspired to attain began to feel empty, and I was left with the feeling of… \n\n “What now?” \n\n Stagnation served as a punch. \n\n Stay in the same place for too long, and you become predictable. \n\n Become predictable, and you get hit. \n\n But the solution is simple. \n\n You gotta keep moving. \n\n Reach a milestone, great. What's the next level you can get to? \n\n Picture it. \n\n Maybe it’s a house in the hills, more supercars, and the ability to fly private whenever you want. \n\n Or you don’t want to feel an ounce of anxiety on any purchase under 6 figures. \n\n You want a penthouse, your girl wants a Birkin, and you want to put a family member on payroll to do nothing. \n\n Sure many of these are materialistic, but it’s your reality – you can design it however you’d like. \n\n You’ve just begun to taste freedom. You’re not even scratching the surface of how you could live, and you’re getting comfortable. \n\n Don’t rob yourself. \n\n True freedom has no bounds, and the only limits come through your imagination. \n\n Let your imagination run free, and you’ll create a new movie in your head that you aspire to live in. \n\n That's your new goal. \n\n Start building towards it now unless you want to wait until you get knocked on your ass. \n\n And by then, it’ll be a hell of a lot harder to get up. \n\n Thanks for reading, and I promise I’m really back for good this time. \n\n Lmk if you liked this one, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "There are some elements of spirituality that I find rather stupid. \n\n Once upon a time, I hired a “life coach.” \n\n After our first call together, I decided I didn’t need him and would instead take life advice from myself. \n\n He was one of those meditate in Bali, peace and self-love types. \n\n This is loosely related to the topic of this email, but it popped into my head when I started thinking about spirituality. \n\n If manifestation and the law of attraction sound a bit out there to you, I’m gonna try to break down what I believe these concepts to be as simply as I can. \n\n Your subconscious is constantly working either for or against you. \n\n When you set goals and intentions, you give your subconscious a direction to follow. \n\n When you fail to do so, your brain finds another way to occupy itself that likely isn’t conducive to the reality you want to build. \n\n The most simple example of this that I see is in my habits and daily routine. \n\n Making content every day has been a priority of mine for a while. \n\n I’ve noticed I’m the most consistent, and content ideas come to me easily when I’m intentional. \n\n If I write “tweet 3 times” or “make 2 videos” on my to-do list for the day, my subconscious starts to help me out. \n\n I’ll be walking to the coffee shop to get an iced vanilla latte from a blue-haired barista with an Adams apple who calls him(her?)self Megan, and boom – I’ll get a random idea for a video. \n\n Could it be a coincidence? \n\n Sure. But nearly every time I set intentions like this, completing the action becomes easier. \n\n Although this is just one basic example, I hope it’s starting to illustrate the point. \n\n What you focus on and put your attention toward grows, even if you’re not conscious of it. \n\n If you’re obsessed with reaching a new income level, your brain is constantly working on that problem in the background. \n\n You’ll get an idea while you’re driving or doing some other mindless activity, and it’ll be the key to reaching that next milestone you’re aiming for. \n\n You might feel like the idea came out of nowhere, but it’s likely because you’ve given your subconscious something to occupy itself with. \n\n And eventually, it finds the solution. \n\n The same thing goes for anything that you want in life. \n\n If you can create a clear image of the lifestyle, people you’re surrounded by, what you’re doing for work, how your routine looks, and the general way of life you want to build… \n\n And you work towards those things… \n\n The combination of the work and setting intentions will eventually reach a perfect storm and you’ll feel like everything somehow ended up exactly how you wanted it. \n\n The way that your goals unfold likely won’t be how you imagined, but that’s a topic for another email. \n\n Hope you enjoyed this one and it made sense to you. \n\n Happy Friday, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I finally compiled my old emails and aded them to this site – you don’t have to opt in over there, just scroll down to view previous newsletters. \n\n ​",

    "body": "A large corner of the internet is very angry at me right now because of this tweet. ​\n\n They’re calling me a scammer posting rage bait to sell my course. \n\n If you’ve been around for a while, you know I don’t have one – although I probably should. \n\n This reaction has been surprising to me as I didn’t think much of the post when I sent it. \n\n The thought was formed while I was in a crowded elevator going up to my apartment. \n\n There was a guy who looked a few years older than me with airpods in and a bag of Chipotle in hand. \n\n He was visibly disgruntled, carrying a black work bag. \n\n When we stopped to let others off on the way up, he spammed the “close door” button, almost shutting it on a few people who were too slow for his liking. \n\n Considering it was a Friday around 5 pm, I imagined he’d just gotten off work after a long, boring week and was eager to get home and devour his burrito on the couch. \n\n I could be completely wrong in my assessment, but I then started thinking about what my life would’ve looked like had I continued on the college, 9-5 route. \n\n And that tweet is what I came up with. \n\n I didn’t mean to attack this life path but rather paint a vivid picture of what I wanted to avoid – who knows if it would’ve actually been my reality. \n\n My Twitter is unusable right now, as every time I refresh, I have dozens of new notifications from wagies who felt attacked by my words. \n\n If anything, they’re proving my point to be true; if they didn’t partially identify with the person I described, they wouldn’t be offended, right? \n\n To me, it looks like they’re trying to defend the lie they’ve sold themselves that they’re happy with an average existence. \n\n I guess every hive needs worker bees. \n\n Anyway, I’ll stop being mean and move on to a completely unrelated topic. \n\n Something that’s been on my mind recently is the difference between short “flings” and hookups compared to longer-term relationships. \n\n Any guy who’s casually dated many girls knows at some point, the game gets a bit too easy. \n\n Although it’s fun, it’s kind of like an iceberg. \n\n You show someone just enough of your personality for them to start to romanticize you. \n\n By nature, you end up saying similar lines, sharing the same stories, and cultivating a particular image of yourself. \n\n You can do this endlessly – revealing a glimpse of your character to new people over and over. \n\n Once you reach the stage where the entire tip of the iceberg has been revealed (pause, no homo), you bounce to the next situationship to do it all over again. \n\n You never give anyone the chance to get to know you past the image you aim to portray. \n\n And there’s nothing wrong with that. Maybe it’s just a phase of life that you’re in, or you’re especially selective about who you spend an extended period of time with. \n\n But if and when you move past the casual fling stage, you realize there’s no longer a place to hide. \n\n Your flaws and insecurities are reflected back to you when you let someone get to know the real you, and that process reveals your self-image. \n\n Fake confidence only lasts for so long, and if there are areas in your identity that you’re not comfortable with, you’ll be forced to make amends with them. \n\n I hope this makes sense to you. I’d go a bit more in-depth, but I just realized that I have hundreds of new subscribers here. \n\n Some of whom are probably ops that were angry at my tweet and will do anything they can to take what I say in this email out of context. \n\n So I’ll let them weed themselves out, and then we’ll continue our regularly scheduled programming. \n\n Anyway, It’s date night with sweet pea tonight! \n\n Can’t wait to try the restaurant and watch our favorite show on the couch!!!! \n\n Hah. \n\n Happy early Easter, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. If you’re new here, watch this to learn more about me and how I built a 7-figure copywriting business. ​\n\n P.P.S. Check out my previous emails here. ​\n\n ​",

    "body": "I’ve grown to love the peaceful Sunday night at home. \n\n When I was in school, this day was always dreadful. \n\n Monday morning was around the corner and the looming stockpile of work I’d been procrastinating was staring me in the face. \n\n I was just debating whether or not I’d write an email to you today. \n\n There are a million excuses my brain could come up with as to why I shouldn’t. \n\n But then I thought about the feeling I get after completing one of these. \n\n It’s like when the endorphins kick in after a tough workout. \n\n Maybe you didn’t want to do it, but you always feel better once it’s done. \n\n There are many things that we resist even though we know they’re good for us. \n\n If you’re building a business you can likely think of a few off the top of your head. \n\n The boring 30 minutes of outreach. \n\n The long meeting with your sales team. \n\n Or the time spent planning your week to stay on track with your next income goal. \n\n Usually, with tasks like this, the only immediate reward you get is internal. \n\n Going to the gym once won’t add 15 pounds of muscle. \n\n You won’t close a client right after sending 20 DM’s. \n\n And writing this email does nothing for me financially at the moment. \n\n But these things give us that type of dopamine that can only be earned when we know we’re doing something positive for our future selves. \n\n When a goal is accomplished, it’s a lagging indicator that shows you consistently completed those sometimes monotonous actions that yield you next to nothing in the short term. \n\n As I contemplated writing this, I considered how I felt yesterday after I clicked send. \n\n I knew replicating that same feeling would be worth it (plus, I actually enjoy writing these). \n\n So I guess that’s my first piece of advice: \n\n Any time you resist something good for you, think back to how you felt after the last time you did it. \n\n And if it’s something that you’ve never done before, replace that image with anything else you once felt a sense of accomplishment after completing. \n\n If you can’t think of anything, you’re cooked. \n\n But if you can, use it as fuel to complete the task in front of you. \n\n This is how you rewire your brain to crave long-lasting, deserved dopamine rather than cheap, social media-infused dopamine. \n\n It’s like how you view a relationship with someone who is easy to get versus someone you have to work for. \n\n You’re always gonna place more value on the person who’s a challenge because you had to earn it, which shows they value themself. \n\n When you bring a girl home after buying her two drinks and making fun of her shoes, that usually means she isn’t wifey material because if you could do it that easily, so could someone else. \n\n Compared to the more elusive girl, who, although she likes you, wants to make sure you’re really the person you appear to be before she fully trusts you. \n\n And that’s the difference between cheap dopamine and deserved dopamine. \n\n The more you can teach your brain to run toward the hill that’s harder to climb, the better. \n\n Anyway, hope you’re avoiding the Sunday scaries and ready to crush the week. \n\n Talk tomorrow, \n\n Ben \n\n ​ Read my previous emails here ​\n\n ​",

Send loom video pitches on Instagram until you get someone on the phone. Talk to the potential client and see what they need. Maybe it’s email copy, ad copy, video scripts, VSL scripts, funnel copy, etc. You are a copywriter. That means your skillset is versatile, and you should be able to fill whatever gap they have in their business to get your foot in the door. Once you close the client, go above and beyond. The bar for service providers is so low that if you simply put in more effort than what is asked, you will be rewarded. They’ll send you referrals, give you a case study, or trust you to operate other parts of their business (meaning you can now charge more + rev share). Now, you turn a $3k/month client into a $10k/month client. Complete the process above a few times, and you’ll be making more than the average investment banker at Goldman Sachs. \n\n Plus, you didn’t have to snort Adderal and cheat off your smart Asian friend named Kevin for four years while getting your bachelor's degree. \n\n That’s what I’d do if I had to start all over. \n\n Even if you’re not a copywriter, the process I outlined is basically all you need to do to accelerate your success in any service-based business. \n\n Your skillset gets you in the door, and you decide what happens now that you’re in the room. \n\n If you earn the trust of the right person, one connection could change your life. \n\n Just be competent and over-deliver. \n\n Now you’re rich. \n\n ​ Thank me by watching this video and leaving a like and comment :) ​\n\n Peace, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. If you’re trying to build a copywriting or “growth operating” business, hit reply and let me know what your biggest roadblock is right now. Building something cool for you. \n\n ​",

    "body": "Yo {{ subscriber.first_name }}, big news… \n\n I ordered a whiteboard. \n\n It comes with a stand, markers, and erasers. \n\n Cool right? \n\n A problem I sometimes encounter when I sit down to write is that I start questioning whether the immediate idea that comes to mind is important enough to warrant an entire email. \n\n As I sit here thinking about where to take this, I’ve probably discarded five ideas. \n\n All of which could have made for a banger email. \n\n But because I don’t feel they’re worthy, I sit here telling myself my mind is blank. \n\n I recently wrote about how your standards determine your reality and that if you want to improve anything, you have to raise the internal bar for what you perceive as acceptable. \n\n I’m now realizing the opposite is also true. \n\n I believe nerds call this a paradox. \n\n (side note real quick – Grammarly fucking sucks. It’s a tool that gives you suggestions on your writing, and everything it tells me to do sounds like it’s attempting to be an off-brand Shakespeare). \n\n Anyway, back to the standards paradox. \n\n Sometimes, if you don’t lower your standards, you won’t do anything. \n\n You want to write the perfect message, make the best video possible, say the right line to the girl, or impress someone you look up to. \n\n The desire for perfection has an inverse effect. \n\n You don’t start, or you filter your thoughts, and you find any excuse not to approach the girl. \n\n This is because the measuring stick is in the wrong place. \n\n Instead of setting an incredibly high bar for the quality of the output, the bar needs to be set for the quantity of the input. \n\n “I need a big idea for this email” becomes “I need to write an email today, no matter what.” \n\n “I need to say the right line to the girl” becomes “I need to walk up and say anything.” \n\n “I need to impress this person” becomes “I need to express myself and say what I’m thinking.” \n\n You’re optimizing for reps instead of trying to protect your ego by being perfect. \n\n Sure, I want to “wow” you with every email I write. \n\n But if I wait until I have a groundbreaking idea every time, I’d be writing once a quarter. \n\n If I make sure to get this done even when I don’t feel heavily inspired, the quality of the output increases in correlation to the input. \n\n That means do more of the thing, and you will get better at it way quicker than you would if you tried to do it perfectly. \n\n There's a Harvard study about this. \n\n Long story short, students in a ceramics class were separated into two groups. One group was told to make the “perfect” clay pot, and the other was told to make as many as possible. \n\n All of the best-looking pots came from the quantity group rather than the quality group. \n\n You should get the point by now. \n\n Be wary not to conflate having “high standards” with a defense mechanism to protect your ego. \n\n Odds are that when you fail to take action, you’re trying to save yourself the embarrassment of realizing that you have some improvement to make. \n\n So does everyone else – and those who improve the fastest are the ones who get the most reps. \n\n Grammarly keeps giving me more dumb suggestions, so I’ll wrap this up here, but go watch my recent YT video if you haven’t already. ​ \n\n Talk tomorrow, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Reply if you liked this one :) ​\n​\n\n ​",

They greeted me with love and told me to have a great day. \n\n I smiled and tossed the barista the keys to my G Wagon. \n\n Then, everything changed. \n\n I opened my phone and went to Instagram. \n\n Boom, I see another pitch from some little ass kid telling me he could be my “growth operator.” \n\n He said, “Ben, did you know you could monetize 1% of your audience??? I can make you $30k per month!” \n\n If you don’t know what “growth operating” is, let me fill you in. \n\n You partner with someone who has a big audience, help them set up a Skool community, and take 50% of the profits. \n\n It’s basically a simplified version of what we do at my info-product agency. \n\n Obviously, I think it’s a solid business model to run, and it’s made me 7 figures. \n\n But I think there’s a bit of a misconception about how it’s been positioned online. \n\n From firsthand experience, I can promise you that helping someone scale an info-product is complex. \n\n There are many moving pieces in these types of businesses, and you need to have a broad skill set along with a general understanding of the info-product space to succeed as a service provider. \n\n You write email copy, build funnels, script video sales letters, build systems, and orchestrate the sales process. \n\n If you’re a complete beginner, it’s damn near impossible to learn all these skills at once. \n\n Instead, it makes much more sense to start by learning one thing and one thing only – copywriting. \n\n It’s the foundation of my business and the reason I’ve scaled to 6 figures per month with my info agency. \n\n We’ve scaled offers from zero to $600k/month and orchestrated over a dozen multi-six-figure launches. \n\n We helped a client go from $30k/mo to $350k/mo in a month and a half, and our smallest clients are making a minimum of $1m/year. \n\n But I didn’t end up in this position by saying I wanted to be a “growth operator.” That term didn’t even exist. \n\n I worked as a freelance copywriter/marketer and eventually accumulated the skills required to run a full-stack agency for info products. \n\n If I were starting all over again, I’d start by becoming the best copywriter I could be. I’d study all types of copy – emails, ads, sales pages, VSLs, direct mail, billboards. \n\n Then I’d start doing outreach to get clients while continuing to learn supplementary skills like funnel building, the different types of funnels, when to use which, how to navigate zapier, sales process management, etc. \n\n Once I had a better understanding of these things, I’d pitch my copywriting clients on more services. \n\n Get one really good case study, and boom – now you have a real business. \n\n Let me clarify, though: I’m not saying the growth operator business model is bad. The guys who teach it are legit. \n\n But it’s not a beginner business model, and you won’t get anywhere close to 50% profits from any creator who knows what they’re doing. \n\n If you’re starting from scratch, learn copy, and the next door will open for you. \n\n Hope you enjoyed this one, \n\n Ben \n\n ​ Read my previous emails here. ​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "Goood morning {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Before I start rambling and forget to tell you, I made a new video explaining how I’ve made $124,255 in a month as a copywriter. You can watch it here after you read this. ​ \n\n I’m sitting on my balcony as I write to you, and the dude who parades around the streets in Brickell while dancing on his bike is blasting the song “Dance Monkey.” \n\n If you’ve ever been here, you probably know who I’m talking about. \n\n He usually annoys me, but I’m in a good mood today, so I’m refraining from sniping him. \n\n Anyway, whenever I see someone online pushing a narrative really hard, it makes me think they’re trying to convince themselves that it’s true. \n\n I’m sure we’ve all been guilty of this at some point. \n\n But I keep seeing Alex Becker pop up on my Twitter timeline, talking about how “fulfilled” he is by getting up at 3 am and sitting at his desk all day. \n\n He’s a pioneer in the online money space, so no shade directly at him – I just think that someone who is truly happy doesn’t have to tell you how happy they are. \n\n In the same way, someone who’s found the right path for themselves doesn’t tell you how your path is wrong. \n\n And a person who has a true relationship with God doesn’t judge you for not following the same rules they follow. \n\n This problem seems to arise when you deeply subscribe to a belief and discard anything that may contradict that belief. You don’t understand that most things are temporary and there are few universal truths. \n\n But because you’ve fully convinced yourself that your way is the right way, when you encounter a situation where that belief is challenged, you take it as a threat. \n\n It’s why someone who follows the college, 9-5 route gets angry when they see a 16-year-old with their annual salary on their wrist. \n\n And on the contrary, it’s why a struggling entrepreneur feels the need to criticize 9-5ers so they can solidify that they made the right choice in their own mind. \n\n There’s a sliver of doubt that they’re attempting to cover up by denying that any alternative could be true. \n\n But that’s the thing – the alternative can almost always be true. \n\n One thing I know with 100% certainty is that my outlook on life will change over time. It’s supposed to. \n\n Different seasons in life bring additional perspectives. \n\n I’m not saying you should lack conviction in your current beliefs if you’ve thoughtfully crafted them. \n\n Just understand that they may change over time. \n\n Don’t marry your beliefs, or you’ll end up bitter when you see someone succeeding in a different lane than you. \n\n There are a million ways to win. Choose yours. \n\n Alright, I gotta go to boxing, and you gotta watch this video. ​ \n\n Happy Friday, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

Your validation is giving me the motivation to upload consistently, so please keep it up. \n\n Recently, I’ve been thinking about how copywriting has impacted my life. \n\n Not only has it helped me build my business, but it’s served as an outlet for me to develop more concrete ideas. \n\n For the last couple of years, I’ve been journaling, tweeting, or writing an email nearly daily. \n\n It feels like a form of art. \n\n In simple terms, I’m taking ideas that are jumbling around in my head and assembling them into a series of words that form a complete thought. \n\n This has made me a more articulate speaker as well. \n\n Whether talking to friends, on a date, or making content, I feel the ripple effect that comes from writing consistently. \n\n Being able to use your words and share your perspective with someone in a way that may persuade them to agree with your beliefs feels like a superpower. \n\n Whether or not you want to build a business that involves copywriting, I genuinely think getting into the habit of writing consistently is one of the highest ROI activities you can do. \n\n Once you hone this skill, a world of opportunities opens up. \n\n It can lead to a successful business, deeper relationships with others, and/or a loyal audience of people on the internet that resonate with your beliefs. \n\n And as I think about the most successful entrepreneurs I know, this is almost always their unfair advantage. \n\n Switching gears a bit, another thing that’s been on my mind is the value that comes with continuous learning. \n\n School tricked us into thinking that education is a boring chore. \n\n This causes most people to put little time into gaining new information once they graduate. \n\n But learning new things should be fun. \n\n I’m sure there are dozens of topics that you are naturally curious about and would enjoy exploring further. \n\n And who knows – maybe it could lead to more money, a better social life, or at least give you an interesting topic to discuss at the dinner table. \n\n When you’re constantly learning new things, you become more unique and interesting. And being a wealth of knowledge is cool. \n\n I encourage you to take some time each day to learn about something new. It doesn't have to be about money or anything that even offers you any tangible benefit. \n\n Simply allow your curiosity to lead you and someway, somehow, you’ll be glad you did. \n\n This is a part of how you develop into a well-rounded version of yourself, which I talk more about here. ​\n\n Anyway, I gotta record some course content (which you’ll have access to soon), and Grammarly is pissing me off again because it keeps suggesting retarded edits to my writing. \n\n Go watch my latest YT video if you haven’t already :) \n\n Love you, \n\n Ben \n\n ​ P.S.

    "body": "I was working out with my boxing coach the other day, practicing a new combination. \n\n While we train, he frequently pauses to give me an analogy or anecdote to help cement new concepts in my head. \n\n In this particular session, he said something that gave me no other choice but to reply with the word “bars” because it applies to any area of life that you are aiming to improve. \n\n He said, “Confidence comes through competence, which comes through repetition.” \n\n In other words, the more reps you get, the better you become, and the better you become, the more confidence you build. \n\n I’m noticing this already on YouTube. \n\n The first time I sat down to make a video, it took me too many tries to count. \n\n I’d start talking and stumble over my words, lose my train of thought, or find an issue with the lighting or how the camera was positioned. \n\n Because of this, making a video felt like I was climbing this big mountain. \n\n Although I still run into occasional issues, it’s become much easier to sit down and knock out a video. \n\n While the quality is subjective, I also feel that my ability to articulate the concept I’m discussing in each video has improved. \n\n The words flow more smoothly, I’m more comfortable being expressive, and I’m getting closer to losing the filter that naturally comes with making videos for the internet. \n\n It’s a perfect example of the quote from my boxing coach. \n\n I don’t want to harp on this one point for too long because it’s so simple yet so difficult to actually practice. \n\n The last thing I’ll say here is that I promise you with full certainty that when you stop putting off things you want to do, it’ll be worth it. \n\n You have to get over the immediate flinch that comes with starting anything new and sometimes have to say, “fuck it if it sucks, it sucks,” and do it anyway. \n\n Over time and repetition, you will get better. \n\n Anyway, I gotta hop on a coaching call, so I’ll keep this one short. \n\n Thanks for reading – and go here to check out the video I uploaded today about why “monk mode” makes you less productive. ​ \n\n Talk tomorrow, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "I sneezed on my walk to get coffee and a stranger said, “Bless you.” \n\n I found that endearing. \n\n Then I saw a grown man wearing a bulky helmet and work clothes zipping through traffic on a scooter. \n\n Those are for children. Grow up. \n\n A couple things on my mind today: \n\n 1. Craftiness is the most underrated skill in business. \n\n It’s the reason some people seem to get lucky. \n\n I know a newer copywriter who’s gotten to multi-five figures a month way faster than most people. \n\n He’s a smart kid but considering he’s brand new to copywriting, it’s safe to assume there are many better writers than him. \n\n But it’s the intangibles that have allowed him to scale to quickly. \n\n I’ve watched him relentlessly follow up with prospects in a nonaggressive way that doesn’t piss them off. \n\n He’ll confidently say “yes” when someone asks for something he has little idea how to do and figure it out on the fly. \n\n He’s simply the boy. \n\n I was talking to my friend Mason about this the other day. \n\n When I describe someone as “the boy” it’s one of the biggest compliments I can give. \n\n It means that they just get it. They’re a good vibe, people like them, they’re socially calibrated. \n\n It’s the highest rank in the Bader-dialogue hierarchy. A step up from “the homie” even. \n\n When someone has the traits above, they \"make it\" — even if they’re not the most skilled. \n\n My mentor when I was building my basketball trainer SMMA used to always say that if we can get someone laughing on a sales call, they will close. \n\n It's a high ROI tip — in a world of cookie-cutter, boring, lifeless robots, be expressive. Crack the borderline offensive joke. Tell your prospect they need to hire you so they can afford better wifi when their connection cuts out on the Zoom call. \n\n Smile. And be handsome. \n\n I got carried away writing this first point and now I forget the other things that were on my mind. \n\n Hmmm. \n\n I’m sitting outside at Starbucks and another corporate drone just rode by on a scooter. \n\n Oh, next thing that that I was thinking about: \n\n 2. If getting clients is a struggle, you’re being a bot. \n\n This relates to my first point but THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. \n\n “I can’t get any clients, I’ve been sending the same retarded pitch to everyone for 3 months and no one replies.” \n\n CHANGE YOUR PITCH. \n\n Test shit. That’s life. You test until something works for you, even if it goes against the “proven system” that cornballs on the internet give you. \n\n One of the copywriters I consulted with got his first couple of clients by digging through Youtubers channels, finding their email addresses, and pitching them via email. \n\n No one taught him that. But that’s ingenuity. \n\n The first time I heard the word “ingenious,” I had just broken into my high school gym to play basketball. \n\n There was a hidden key in the storage closet to turn the lights on and lower the hoops. I’d found it months before, but one day, I walked in there, and it was gone. \n\n “Goddamnit, Terry,” I thought to myself. She was the athletic trainer who would always kick me out because it was a liability for a minor to be in the gym without supervision. \n\n I bent the metal part of an old lanyard I found in my backpack and made a new key. It worked. \n\n A few days later, Terry walked in right after I used my makeshift key to get the baskets down. \n\n She asked how I did it, and I told her I had made a new key. That’s when she said, “Well, that was ingenious of you.” \n\n In my head, I was like “fuck yeah it was Terry.” \n\n Anyway, I’m rambling, but if you’re stuck right now, BE CRAFTY. BE INGENIOUS. DONT BE A LUKE BELMAR IMAN GHADZI ANDREW TATE CLONE. STEAL YOUR GRANDMAS COMPUTER. SELL YOUR KIDNEY ON THE BLACK MARKET. SEND THE MAFIA TO A PROSPECTS HOUSE. \n\n Ok, thanks for reading all this, now go here to uncover the secrets of the Universe. ​\n\n Talk tm, sorry for yelling. \n\n Bye, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "The hardest part of starting anything is the beginning. \n\n When I open this document to a blank page, and a blinking cursor, a voice in my head tries to convince me that today isn’t the day. \n\n “You’re out of ideas for now. You’re uninspired. Just wait until it comes to you,” it says. \n\n This is a familiar voice. \n\n I hear it whenever I turn on the camera to make a video. \n\n It screams at me when the cold water touches my body in an ice bath and tells me to get out. \n\n Maybe you’ve heard it too. \n\n When you listen to it, you’ll be convinced not to go to the gym, avoid approaching the girl, and wait until the “perfect time” to start the business. \n\n A few years ago, I listened to an audiobook about this topic during a plane ride. \n\n It’s called The War Of Art by Steven Pressfield. \n\n He refers to this voice as “resistance” and describes it as “A universal force that has one mission: to keep things as they are.” \n\n You’re likely aware of the things you resist – consciously or unconsciously. \n\n You also probably don’t want to stay the same forever. \n\n And you know that the only way to change is to overcome your initial desire to flinch when taking the first half step. \n\n You can ask yourself three questions to identify what you’re resisting right now and make a convincing argument for moving toward it. \n\n Answer these with me real quick: \n\n 1. What’s one thing I want that I’m not getting right now? \n\n 2. What’s stopping me from getting this thing? \n\n 3. What would happen if I could do this thing? \n\n Got it? \n\n Okay. \n\n By answering question one, you thought of something you want to do that you’re avoiding. \n\n In question two, you selected the first excuse that came to mind for why you couldn’t do it. \n\n And in question three, hopefully, you realized how stupid that excuse is because of the benefits, the person you become, and the new life you unlock by overcoming your resistance. \n\n It’s literally impossible to make a logical argument for why you should avoid the things you’re avoiding. \n\n Your excuses are bullshit. \n\n That’s your ego trying to defend against change. \n\n Because with change comes the possibility that things don’t go as planned. \n\n Maybe your video gets three likes, and they come from your grandma, mom, and little brother. \n\n Even your cousin gave it a thumbs down. \n\n Or maybe you get rocked in the face the first time you step in the ring. \n\n If those are big enough reasons to stay where you are, be my guest. \n\n But by making that decision, you’re also closing the door to the possibility that it will eventually work out. \n\n Sure, maybe it will start slowly. \n\n Maybe things won’t go as planned even after you beat resistance. \n\n But one day, your efforts will compound. \n\n You’ll hang in there long enough and have the results to show for it. \n\n That’s when you’ll laugh at the fact that you ever were scared to pursue the things you want. \n\n You in? \n\n Cool. \n\n ​ Now, go here and let me tell you about the one trait you need to make as much money as you possibly want. ​ \n\n Love you, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "Today was a tough one for my speaking ability. \n\n I probably have over 100 clips on my camera that will all be deleted. \n\n Earlier today I was trying to make a VSL for a new offer I’m putting together where you can work with me directly. \n\n After dozens of takes, I finally had a video that I thought was sufficient. \n\n I exported it and was about to call it a day. \n\n Then I watched it a couple more times and decided that I didn’t like it. \n\n I took a walk to clear my head and was inspired to make a Youtube video once I got back. \n\n 20 takes later, I still didn’t have a complete video. The sun went down and the lighting in my apartment makes the video look grainy once it gets dark. \n\n I turned off the camera and am now sitting here writing to you. \n\n It’s funny because yesterday I wrote an email to you about overcoming the initial resistance you feel when starting something new. \n\n And today, I couldn’t beat it. \n\n I started to feel bad for myself after the initial VSL failure. \n\n And then during my walk earlier, I opened an email reply from someone on this list. \n\n They said “Thank you Ben for rekindling this flame inside me with these emails.” \n\n That’s when I realized that the decision to pity myself after things didn’t go as planned is incredibly selfish. \n\n I’m making videos and sharing content on the because it feels like something I have to do. \n\n As a byproduct, I get to inspire other people and impact lives for the better. \n\n Obviously, I’m not on the front lines here risking my life for the benefit of humanity, but making \n\n content like this is probably one of the most influential things I can do with my time at the moment. \n\n When I think about, the possibility that I even impact a few people for the better vastly makes up for days like today, where I struggle. \n\n I get messages and comments every day from people telling me that I’ve helped them in some way. \n\n And to say “woe is me” while sitting and pouting about a couple of unsuccessful videos is childish, bitch-like behavior. I have a responsibility here, and it’s my obligation to uphold it. I’m too blessed to feel sorry for myself. The mission doesn’t allow for pity. \n\n This is the pep talk I heard in my head. Perhaps it applies to you as well. \n\n In general, I think the worst thing you can do in any situation is to feel sorry for yourself. It makes you powerless. It’s a slap in the face to anyone who supports you or roots for you, as you’re not even giving the same level of respect to yourself. \n\n No more pity parties. You have responsibilities to tend to and a divine calling to follow. \n\n Don’t be a bitch. \n\n Ok bye thx for reading Happy Friday. \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Did you watch my recent YT video yet? ​ \n\n P.P.S Lmk if you liked this one <3 \n\n ​",

    "body": "I started writing this in my head during my morning run. \n\n The trail was abnormally crowded today. \n\n I had to weave through an abundance of slow walkers, oblivious dog owners, strollers, and preoccupied middle-aged Hispanic men. \n\n It was windy, to the point that the water from the Miami River to my left was blowing up onto the walkway. \n\n The trees were rattling, but I pierced through the wind in my white Nikes, which I’ve been wearing for the past year. \n\n It’s definitely time to buy a new pair, but completing minuscule tasks like going to the shoe store feels equivalent to climbing Mt. Everest to me. So I’ll probably wait until the sole starts to fall off or my toes bust through the mesh. \n\n I was walking back home after my run when I ran into my friend Bo. Bo is a copywriter that Mason and I have been coaching for the last six months or so. \n\n She quickly reached $10k per month inside Mason's program, the Copy MBA Inner Circle, and then started asking me for help scaling further. \n\n With my help she’s scaled past $50k per month by turning her copywriting business into a full stack info agency. \n\n A few weeks ago, I was thinking about how we could create more success stories like hers. \n\n She started by learning the skill of copywriting and then added many of the other services that I offer to clients. \n\n Things like funnel building, VSLs, webinars, and building all the systems on the backend. \n\n It seems like this is the common path for those who get the best results when first starting out as a beginner. \n\n They get good at copy and then expand their skill set to become more valuable to their clients. \n\n This gave me the idea to partner up with Mason inside of Copy MBA. \n\n Over the last few weeks, I’ve been building out course content to add to the program, and I’m nearly ready to launch it. \n\n If you’re just starting out, this is gonna be a cheat code for you. \n\n Not only will you get access to Mason and his team, along with all of the existing content inside of there… \n\n But you’ll also begin to learn the skills that you’ll need to know to eventually be able to charge clients up to $40k in a single month the way I have. \n\n I’m putting the final touches on everything, and because you’re on this list, you’ll get first access to it once it goes live. \n\n I can promise you with full certainty that if you’re a complete beginner who’s looking to build a copywriting business, this is gonna be the most valuable resource you have at your disposal. \n\n I’ll be giving you more info in the coming emails. \n\n For now, go here and check out this video that’ll help you develop a magnetic aura and make other people love you. ​ \n\n Happy Sunday, and thanks for reading, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

    "body": "The other day, I sent you an email titled “HOW TO NOT BE A BOT.”\n\n It’s the most important life hack you can understand.\n\n It’ll get you clients, friends, perceived status, etc. Simply put, not being a bot makes you a winner.\n\n Today, I want to dive into the psychology behind this.\n\n In college, there was a kid in my pledge class who we called a robot.\n\n For the sake of the story, I’ll call him Robo-Joe.\n\n Robo-Joe had one goal in life:\n\n Get with sorority girls.\n\n He was decent-looking and our school was literally 70% female, so the odds were stacked in his favor.\n\n But there was a problem…\n\n He had the charisma of a rock.\n\n Joe was the type of person that likely doesn’t have inner dialogue, but if he did I imagine it would sound as follows:\n\n “I want gorls. I go to school that 70% gorl. I join frat to seem normal so I get mor gorl. I go gym to get big and strwong so gorl like me.”\n\n Because he was a robot, he took a very direct approach to the above goal.\n\n He thought that all of the things above would make him desirable.\n\n And while he did have some ‘success,’ Joes intentions became clear to anyone with half a brain.\n\n He didn’t pledge a fraternity because he wanted to make genuine friends; he did so to make it look like he had friends.\n\n He was obsessed with the gym because, in his mind, it would make him desirable to women.\n\n Robo-Joe tried to cover up his intentions by becoming your typical jacked frat bro.\n\n And he wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, so it didn’t really work.\n\n Fun fact: our wardens actually made him play brain games for 20 minutes a day and report back with his progress because he was quite slow.\n\n Anyway, I’m telling you all about Robo-Joe because this is the approach most people take when they want something.\n\n Let’s say you want to get your first client and decide that you’re just gonna spam DM a bunch of people without doing any research on who they are or what you should offer them.\n\n You do that for 3 months, and it doesn’t work because you’re retarded so you quit.\n\n That’s the direct Robo-Joe approach.\n\n Let’s talk about the better way to get what you want…\n\n The first five info-product clients I got were all online basketball trainers.\n\n I went 4/4 on outreach, and one of them (who had half a million followers) reached out to me first.\n\n So, to make it clear, I sent four messages and got five clients, which is statistically impossible if you’re not named Ben Bader.\n\n The reason this worked wasn’t because of my script or even any crazy case study.\n\n It was because of two things:\n\n I existed on the internet. I was posting content about basketball trainer marketing and running ads. I used my brain to reach out at the right time. If they posted a new offer or something that I thought I could help with on their story, that’s when I’d send a DM. Actually, I guess I lied — the third element was that I was half decent at writing copy and providing the other services I was offering, so I was confident in the way I spoke to them.\n\n That’s the anti-robot approach. It might sound like it’ll take longer, but it diminishes your need to get lucky by spam DM’ing a bunch of people.\n\n I don’t know if there was any saving Robo-Joe, but if he had put the time into becoming someone who was desirable to women instead of trying shallow fixes to fake it, maybe he would’ve had a shot.\n\n ​ Anyway, I figured out the key to happiness and share it with you in this video. ​\n\n See you over there,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​",

It makes time fly by, even when you’re completing a rather trivial task. \n\n The construction workers show up every day and do their best.

    "body": "I was sitting at lunch today with a couple of friends, and we talked about what people do after college. \n\n All three of us could think of a handful of people we knew in school who are now just drifting. \n\n They either moved back in with their parents or they’re working some dead end job “figuring things out.” \n\n This is absolutely asinine to me. \n\n Wasn’t the point of college to find some direction and career path? \n\n Many of my friends who graduated about a year ago have reached out to me, expressing unhappiness about the situation it’s left them in. \n\n They’d spent the last four years (and hundreds of thousands of dollars) pretending like this day would never come. \n\n Now, it’s not like they’re doomed for life, but it’s definitely a hell of a lot harder. \n\n I’m not writing this to shame them but rather to warn you about what could happen if you try to ignore the inevitable destination that it will lead you to. \n\n How long will you lie to yourself and say you’ll make a change “one day?” \n\n That day will never come if you don’t create it. \n\n It starts by making the conscious decision to design your life in a way that will steer you in a new direction. \n\n Your habits, thoughts, and beliefs must begin to change. \n\n This is how you step into a new identity. \n\n The worst place in life is in the middle, drifting between what you want and what you have. \n\n If your actions aren’t in alignment with the life you want to create, you’re in danger. \n\n You can continue ignoring that feeling that tells you that you want more, or you can decide to actually commit to building this new reality. \n\n I know this sounds simple, but if you objectively audit what you’re doing right now, and it isn’t propelling you to where you want to be, you have a problem. \n\n If you choose to ignore the problem, it will grow like a parasite in the back of your mind. \n\n Eventually, you’ll be the unhappy 50-year-old with a life full of “what ifs.” \n\n Stop drifting, my friend. \n\n Life is beautiful when you create it. I’m telling you firsthand that the hardship that comes with change is worth the experiences and freedom it grants you access to. \n\n Take control of your life before it’s too late, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. If you want to build a copywriting business, I have an opportunity for you. \n\n You may have seen that I recently partnered with my friend Cardinal Mason inside of Copy MBA. \n\n It’s his birthday tomorrow, and we’re running a $1,000 discount for the next few days. \n\n ​ To get access to it, go here and apply now. ​\n\n This is limited and won’t be available for long. \n\n P.P.S. I made a new video that’ll show you how to get through the days when you don’t feel like being productive. \n\n ​ You can check it out here. ​\n\n ​",

    "body": "When I moved to Miami almost two years ago, I was a very different person. \n\n I was making around $15k-$20k per month, I had less confidence, and the move here was intimidating to me. \n\n The last ~20 months have been transformational. \n\n My income has increased by more than 5x, and my social circle has expanded while I’ve developed tighter bonds with the few people I’d consider brothers. \n\n The entire way I view myself has changed. \n\n I started doing many of the things that were on my “one-day” list. \n\n My personal brand has grown, I’ve picked up new hobbies, and my lifestyle is exactly the way I used to dream of. \n\n I’ve taken a series of actions that have created a ripple effect. \n\n When you do one thing that you’re a bit nervous to do, your brain realizes that the fears you have around that thing are self-imagined. \n\n The ceiling that you’ve placed on yourself starts to get removed. \n\n This makes it easier to tackle the next thing you’re putting off, and so on. \n\n But knocking down that first domino is always the hardest. \n\n Right now, you have beliefs that align with the person that you are in the present. \n\n To do something new, those beliefs have to change – but they won’t change by standing in the mirror and telling yourself affirmations, watching self-help YouTube videos, or meditating in front of a Tony Robbins poster. \n\n You must go out into the world and give yourself real data that an alternate identity is possible. \n\n Obviously, I can sit here and tell you this over and over, but it won’t mean shit to you until you actually put it into practice. \n\n Throughout my days as a basketball player, this was something I struggled with. \n\n I was always in the gym, watching film, writing down goals, and doing everything I could to make my hoop dreams come true. \n\n But I was never fully able to step into that new reality and play to what I knew my true ability was in real games. \n\n It’s almost like I was rewarding myself for all the preparation I was doing rather than actually applying it where it mattered. \n\n This is similar to rehearsing the “perfect” lines to say to a girl at the bar, but when you get there, you stand in the corner refreshing the weather app. \n\n Or you could do all the research possible about copywriting, read all the books, and buy courses, but never send a DM and try to get a client. \n\n Practice means nothing without action. \n\n Sometimes, it’s better to be less prepared and dive in head first rather than sharpening your sword to never pull it out. \n\n Do the things that are difficult for you and watch your limitations evaporate. \n\n I promise it’ll be worth it. \n\n Talk tomorrow, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Our $1,000 discount on the Copy MBA Inner Circle is live – go here to start building your copywriting business. ​\n\n ​",

Any fun weekend plans??? \n\n Hahaha. \n\n Grow up. \n\n It’s such a beautiful day here that I feel bad for anyone who isn’t in the state of Florida. \n\n Besides those who are in Orlando. Or even worse… Tampa. Ew. \n\n Imagine the highlight of your city being a predatory theme park or a place called “Meat Market.” \n\n At least Tampa has “The Edition” - a 3.5-star hotel in any major city, but seems to be the main attraction since there’s nothing else to do there. They also only employ members of the LGBTDJKD community. \n\n I’m not trying to be homophobic, but members of this community don’t seem to have the best work ethic, so things tend to take longer at this hotel. However, they are very good at making lattes. \n\n Anyway I’m sitting outside Starbucks, sipping on a cold brew with vanilla cream and sugar, and thinking about how much of a hypocrite I am. \n\n I just got jealous of a homeless man because he looked happy and had really good posture. \n\n I can’t help but judge the man a couple tables away from me wearing a suit on his lunch break. \n\n I started off this email by making fun of those who look forward to Fridays and weekends, but I’d be lying if I said my mood isn’t slightly better on days like this. \n\n And if I actually followed the majority of the advice I give on the internet, I’d be a billionaire by now. \n\n A wise man once said, “The most honest people are hypocrites.” \n\n The wise man who said that is the same one who’s writing this email. \n\n And if you’re still reading by now you’re probably wondering where the lesson is or what I’m gonna “teach” you here. \n\n My goal is not to teach but rather entertain. \n\n The richest people are the entertainers. Think about Tate. His message wasn’t something that others hadn’t said prior. \n\n But he blew up because the guy is just outrageous. The way he speaks, the stories he tells, and the unapologetic expression of his thoughts. \n\n It was refreshing to see someone who genuinely seemed not to care if people didn’t agree with him while simultaneously saying what everyone else was thinking. \n\n On another note, most of the successful people I know are really lazy when they’re uninterested. \n\n Myself included — I’ve always had a really hard time doing things I don’t want to do. \n\n I’ll wait until the final deadline, half-ass the project, cheat off the Asian kid, and do everything I can to get by while putting in minimal effort. \n\n But when I’m bought in and find something that I’m interested in, I turn into an autistic computer engineer. \n\n I can spend hours at my desk without losing focus. It occupies my mind constantly. \n\n Maybe you’re the same. \n\n One thing I’ve started to understand about this is that obsession is created, not found. \n\n You don’t “stumble” upon something you’re passionate about. \n\n But rather, you create that passion by diving into a project and learning to love the mundane tasks that come with it. \n\n Ok, I gotta hop on a call, but before I go, I’m feeling generous today, so I’m giving $100 to a random subscriber who watches and comments on my recent YT video. \n\n ​ Go here and watch this video (leave a comment with your favorite thing I said in the video). \n\n Considering my audience is still relatively small, you have like a 1/10 chance of winning probably. \n\n Bye love you, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. If you want me to help you build a copywriting or “growth operator” business, check this out. ​\n\n ​",

It doesn’t let you enjoy the moment. It’s a constant chatter that won’t be shut up by ignoring it. \n\n Whether it’s work you’re avoiding, a decision, or the direction of your life entirely — your soul knows when your actions aren’t in alignment with your desires. \n\n You’ll be in a constant state of anxiety when you’re avoidant. \n\n You can lie to others, but you can’t lie to yourself. \n\n But honestly if this sounds familiar, you’re one of the lucky ones. \n\n You now know that there’s some fire in your soul. \n\n And you know that there’s a direction it’s pulling you in. \n\n It’s up to you to follow it :) \n\n Talk tomorrow, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

    "body": "The money you want is right in front of you; you’re just looking in the wrong places. \n\n This is something I think about often. \n\n Every now and then, I’ll hop on calls with people who are clearly sitting on a goldmine. \n\n Maybe they have an in-demand skill, a large audience that isn’t properly monetized, or some other form of leverage they are not accessing. \n\n From the outside looking in, the right move is so clear to me. \n\n But it’s almost like they’re wearing tinted glasses that are blocking them from making the obvious decision that could drastically increase their income. \n\n It’s like when you have a friend who gets into a relationship with someone who clearly isn’t good for them. \n\n They’re “drunk in love” and can’t see the red flags or problems associated with the relationship. \n\n Once the glasses are removed, their vision becomes clear, and the problem vanishes. \n\n This works the same way in business. \n\n People continuously look for the next shiny object, the next move, or the alternative direction they could take. \n\n But they refuse to look at what’s right in front of them. \n\n Let’s say you get a copywriting client who pays you $3k per month to run their email marketing. \n\n You think to yourself, “Okay, this is great. Now I just need to get a few more clients, and I’ll be at $10k per month.” \n\n You then spend the majority of your time trying to get more clients. \n\n It doesn’t go as planned, and the client you had dropped you after a few months because they weren’t getting the desired result from email. \n\n Now you’re back at square one. \n\n The problem? \n\n You were looking in the wrong place. \n\n Had you objectively assessed their business, you would’ve noticed that their funnel needs work, their VSL is shit, and their sales team isn’t following up with leads. \n\n Because of this, your emails didn’t increase revenue because there were other holes that needed to be patched. \n\n But you weren’t focused on that. \n\n You were spamming strangers on the internet, trying to get another client. \n\n What if you had fixed the other gaps in your clients' business? \n\n Let's say you rewrite their VSL, build them a new funnel, and help the sales team manage their leads. \n\n Between these changes and your email marketing efforts, the revenue increases by 2 or 3x. \n\n And because you were the person who helped them make more money, they’re happily giving you a percentage of the revenue. \n\n Boom - you just turned your $3k/month client into a $10k/month client because you maximized the opportunity in front of you. \n\n Here’s the part where I shamelessly plug the Copy MBA Inner Circle and show you how Vagner is doing exactly what I described above. \n\n ​ He’s already made an extra $2k because of it. \n\n To get access to the same information he has, a community of other copywriters, and direct coaching from me and the Copy MBA team, go here now to learn more. ​\n\n See you over there, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }}. \n\n I don’t know why, but I have this deep disdain and partial jealousy for people who “sell out” for the info bag. \n\n By “sell out” I mean normify their offer. \n\n All their videos turn into hyper-edited VSLs. \n\n They talk about extremely basic and broad concepts. \n\n And their sole goal is to convince the masses that the business model they’re selling is the “easiest way to hit $10k/month.” \n\n This works. You dumb down all of your content and sell the dream to naive beginners. \n\n You know 90% or more of your customers will fail, but this is usually how to make the most money in coaching. \n\n Is it unethical? \n\n Not necessarily — if your program is good and some people still get results, you can make the argument that you did your best. \n\n But it’s just not my style. \n\n Even though I’m now partnered with Copy MBA and am financially incentivized to tell you how “easy” copywriting is, I can’t. \n\n No business model is easy. \n\n I think it’s a better option than dropshipping, trading, wholesale RE, and many other business models. \n\n But is it any better for a beginner than doing sales or TikTok shop affiliate? \n\n No. \n\n And will most people who buy any course or coaching program fail, no matter the business model? \n\n Yes. \n\n I don’t mean to be pessimistic here. I just firmly believe that the intangibles make or break you. \n\n There are winners and losers. \n\n ​ The best copywriting program in the world can help you, but at the end of the day, you will never outperform your self-image. \n\n And if you’re unable to transform yourself into a person deserving of financial success, it will always elude you. \n\n No matter if you’re a copywriter, dropshipper, TikTok shop affiliate, or onlyfans thot. \n\n Actually, OF might be the one exception. \n\n Anyway, I’ll always keep it real with you. Even if that costs me money. \n\n You will succeed at any business if you’re a winner. If you’re a loser, good luck. \n\n Enough rambling for today — I made a vlog yesterday and will give a random commenter $100. \n\n ​ Watch me live a normal day in Miami here.

    "body": "It’s gotten to the point in Miami where the second you step outside, you start sweating. \n\n I just got back from a 30 min walk, and I’m very wet (pause no homo). \n\n As you may have seen, I recently started uploading on Youtube. \n\n It’s been my obsession for the last month, and I’ve been reminded of many lessons, three of which I’ll share with you now: \n\n 1. You allow for the possibility of greatness when you stop trying to be perfect. \n\n The other day, I woke up scrambling for an idea. \n\n I wanted to start my next Youtube video with narration and b-roll. \n\n As I walked to Starbucks to get some shots and try to think of an idea, I realized it was right in front of me (watch the video for context) ​\n\n The lesson: \n\n Your best work and most fruitful business ventures usually happen by accident. \n\n Just get the ball rolling, and things will work out. \n\n As long as you’re aware and conscious of the opportunities that appear in front of you, you’ll stumble into greatness. \n\n 2. Don’t let your fear of heightened standards stop you from starting. \n\n This is something I talk about often, as I’m frequently reminded of it. \n\n As you progress in any endeavor, you add more pressure by revealing to yourself what you are capable of. \n\n You’re probably subconsciously aware of this now, and it could be the reason that you’re putting off a goal. \n\n I’m reminded of this with each video I post. There's this voice in the back of my head that says, “What’s next? How are you gonna top that?” \n\n It’s a constant pressure that comes with a certain standard. But I can promise it’s far better than the anxiety that comes with suppressing your desires. \n\n 3. The best lessons are pulled from the trenches. \n\n Any time I take on a new endeavor, I’m able to see many similarities between each pursuit. \n\n I’ve learned more from things like boxing, lifestyle maxxing, and making content than I have from any coaching program or course. \n\n Side quests are often life's best teachers. \n\n And who knows, maybe you’ll learn a lesson or open a door that’ll help you financially as well. \n\n Anyway – here’s the link to my new Youtube video. ​\n\n As always I’ll give $100 to a random subscriber who comments their favorite part from the vid. \n\n Love you, and lmk if you liked this one :) \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "“Attention is the new currency.” \n\n You’ve likely heard this before. \n\n Make content, build an audience, and sell them something. \n\n It’s one of the quickest ways people are getting rich. \n\n Over the last few years, it seems like the floodgates have been opened. \n\n Everyone and their Grandma are content creators. \n\n I can’t go to lunch without seeing people with hundreds of thousands of followers. \n\n It literally seems like it’s one in every three people. \n\n This is what has allowed me to build my agency. \n\n As you may know, I work with people who have a big audience and sell information. \n\n We write their copy, build their funnels, script their videos, and basically manage the entire backend for them, so all they have to do is make more videos and get more attention. \n\n The more eyeballs they get, the more money they make, which makes our services more valuable and they end up paying us more. \n\n This is the simplest way I can explain my business's role in the “attention economy.” \n\n We’re leveraging a vast skillset, time, and expertise to capitalize on creators' existing audiences and help them make way more money than they would without us. \n\n For most of our clients, our work is relatively the same – we build the similar landing pages, write similar emails, and even the VSL and webinar scripts are relatively templated. \n\n On our end, there’s minimal difference in the workload between a client who pays us $5k/month versus one who pays us $30k/month. \n\n The singular variable is attention. \n\n We recently started working with a guy who has a really solid audience. \n\n He has multiple six-figure followers, good engagement, and his content is fire. \n\n From one post on Instagram and Tik Tok, he’s gotten the number of leads that we should be able to generate around a quarter million dollars from over the next week. \n\n From one post. \n\n Let me reiterate – the one difference between him and someone who makes little money from info is the audience. \n\n Someone else could have the same story, results, success, expertise, etc. \n\n But if they don’t have a loyal audience of people who know, like, and trust them on the internet, it means nothing. \n\n Attention is everything. \n\n Whether you’re trying to build your own coaching business or you’re doing something similar to me. \n\n Your marketing efforts, systems, and positioning do not matter if no one is seeing it. \n\n So if you’re a copywriter or “gRoWtH oPeraToR” keep this in mind when trying to get clients. \n\n To get a killer case study, you need a killer client – a pig with lipstick on is still a pig. lol. \n\n Anyway, I’ve been having a ton of fun working with the students inside the Copy MBA Inner Circle, and it’s dope to see them getting results from it. \n\n ​ If you wanna make money as a copywriter or growth operator you should go here and apply so I can make you rich ok?

Early in the first quarter, he hit two open shots in a row, and from that point on, he’s been lighting it up. \n\n This is something you’ll commonly see amongst the best scorers in basketball. \n\n If they get an easy shot early on, this will help them get into a rhythm, and it’s going to be a long night for the defense. \n\n This “easy bucket method” is something I use almost every day (off the basketball court). \n\n When I sit down to work, most of my tasks each day fall into one of two categories: \n\n 1. Easy to complete, low time commitment \n\n Or… \n\n 2. Difficult to complete, higher time commitment \n\n I almost always start with one of the easier, lower-friction actions, and once I knock a few of those out, I build momentum – Which makes it much easier to move on to the more time-intensive stuff. \n\n This is one of my best “productivity hacks,” and I use it whenever I am trying to achieve a bigger goal. \n\n Very simple concept, but try it out next time you find yourself procrastinating. \n\n Anyway, check out my recent video if you haven’t already 👇 \n\n ​ I have $100 for a random subscriber who leaves a comment about their favorite part of the vid :) \n\n Night {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "All of the best things in life are earned. \n\n This is especially true for men and is something that you’ll constantly be reminded of as you “level up.” \n\n There are no shortcuts. \n\n True genuine friendships, the girl who loves and admires you, and the impact on other people are all things that you cannot access by finding a loophole. \n\n You have to become “him.” \n\n Money alone won’t do this for you. \n\n There is one thing that usually has the biggest impact on the quality of experience you get to access. \n\n And it’s your relationships. \n\n First with yourself and then with others. \n\n Let’s say you get “lucky” financially. \n\n You hit a big crypto rug pull, you run scam eCom brands, or you start selling Viagra to old men and pimp out your grandmother on OF. \n\n It works, and you get “access” to all the money you could need, which, in theory, will buy you the best experiences that life has to offer. \n\n But there’s this deep-seated belief in your head that feels like you’re unworthy. \n\n While you earned the money you wanted you didn’t improve your relationship with yourself along the way. \n\n Maybe your back was never against the wall and you didn’t develop the grit that comes with digging yourself out of a hole. Or maybe you don’t fully respect yourself because you’ve found success through nefarious means. \n\n Because of these factors, you aren’t the type of person that other amazing, genuine people want to be around. \n\n You end up attracting shallow people into your life – guys who would slander your name if it’s in their best interest and a girl who would leave your table at the club to go to Futures table (rip). \n\n You see a lot of these types in Miami and they’re usually dripped out in Chrome Hearts. \n\n These are people who “beat the system.” \n\n They found the financial success that others dream of, perhaps without having to go through the usual hardship or personal development process. \n\n But they don’t get to fully enjoy the money because they haven’t become the person who is worthy of incredible relationships, as you attract what you are. \n\n And even if you “earn” all the money in the world, you still have to earn your relationships. \n\n Laying on the beach in Barbados means nothing if you aren’t with people you love. \n\n Driving your dream car through the Hollywood hills doesn’t hit the same if the girl in your passenger seat only likes you for your money. \n\n Opening your banking app to a number that would allow you to retire at any moment feels empty when you don’t like the person whose face you see in the reflection of your screen. \n\n Your relationships are everything and there are no shortcuts that will earn you respect. \n\n So if you’re in the trenches right now and you feel like you’re not reaping the rewards of your efforts… \n\n Congratulations. You’re in the process of developing into the person who is worthy of the reality that you want. \n\n Sorry for the hiatus. Good to be back, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Go here if you want my help in building a copywriting or \"growth operating\" business. ​\n\n P.P.S. I’m thinking about putting together a program for coaches, consultants, and course sellers who are under $100k per month.

I'm seated slightly behind him so he wouldn’t see me coming. \n\n Plus he can’t be more than 140 pounds and one right hook to the temple should knock him out. \n\n Damnit. no weapon, just airpods. \n\n From the moment I sat down he’s been talking abnormally loud. \n\n Most of which has been mumble nonsense but at one point he asked the man in the floral shirt at the table in front of him if he could come sit with him. \n\n The man politely declined. \n\n He just took a final sip out of each of his three bottles and is now flailing his arms above his head. \n\n Smoke break. He put a cigarette in his mouth and walked outside. \n\n This is fun. It's usually only homeless people that you get to see have outbursts like this. \n\n Other than a few staff members, no one else in the restaurant has even noticed him. \n\n Everyone is just in their own little bubble, dealing with their own ambitions, obstacles, and problems. \n\n I guess if there’s a lesson here it’s that letting the opinions of others stop you from doing something you want is so silly. \n\n First of all, you’re gonna die one day. \n\n Second of all, who cares what they think. \n\n And third, they’re probably not even gonna notice you. \n\n Our friend is back from his smoke break. \n\n He asked for another beer and the waiter reluctantly told him that they aren’t legally allowed to serve more than three alcoholic beverages. \n\n I wonder if that’s true or if he was just worried that this guy was gonna start dancing on the table. \n\n Instead the waiter went and got him some water. The manic man got up and gave him a hug. \n\n He drunkenly said, “Thank you. I’ve had such a rough day,” grabbed his things and walked out with hope in his stride. \n\n Aw. What a nice happy ending. \n\n I guess everyone’s dealing with their own shit and it's not good for us to judge. \n\n Anyway – This video is one of my favorites and it’s something that helped me go from being a normal college kid to building my dream life over the last 4 years. ​\n\n See you over there, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

The best thing money does for you is it offers peace of mind and freedom. \n\n You earn yourself the freedom to take a long walks or enjoy a cigar on a bench on a random Thursday afternoon. \n\n Without having to worry about bills, drama at a job you hate, or any of the other things that normies have to worry about. \n\n You can say what you want. You can think how you want. You can side quest. You can try new things and embark on “meaningless” pursuits. \n\n Money is freedom. \n\n And it 100% makes your life 100x better because it lets you live like you don’t have it, while giving you the peace of mind of someone who does have it. \n\n Getting rich is the most selfless thing you can do. \n\n Because then you have the clarity to go figure out what you're supposed to do here. \n\n Make sense? \n\n Let me know if you liked this one, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

A lot. \n\n And it bought him a Bugatti. \n\n Fuck. I want a Bugatti. \n\n Let’s do more of the basics and have a great week, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

    "body": "There are two types of people in this world. \n\n The first type of person is the one who hesitates to start a business because they’re worried about how they’d pay taxes if they were to make money. \n\n They sit there and think about every possible problem that they could possibly run into. \n\n “What happens if I get a client and then they ask me to do something that I don’t know how to do?” \n\n These are the types that want a “full step-by-step playbook” to start a business. \n\n It’s like they’re taking the 9-5er approach to business and need to be told what to do every step of the way. \n\n There’s an acronym that accurately describes this type: \n\n NGMI (not gonna make it). \n\n They’re effectively toddlers. \n\n The second type of person is the one who adopts a different mindset. \n\n Sure, they still have hesitations, fears and doubts. \n\n And they don’t know what every step of the staircase will look like. \n\n But they take action despite these factors. \n\n There’s a different acronym that they follow: \n\n FITFO (figure it the fuck out). \n\n Yesterday I found a perfect example of these two people in the comment section of one of my Youtube videos. \n\n One person commented “This video is ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY POINTLESS” and right underneath him was a comment that read: \n\n “Exactly what I’m going through rn. Your YouTube was really put in my life for a reason. The timing of this video is impeccable” \n\n Can you guess who’s who in this example? \n\n Sure I’m biased because it’s my own video but this was interesting to me. \n\n How can two people watch the same exact video and have completely opposite reactions? \n\n Perception. \n\n Your reality is colored by the lens in which you view the world. \n\n If you think someone is coming to save you, or you think there’s a step by step system that everyone who “makes it” follows, you will find information that lacks training wheels useless. \n\n Instead you’ll watch hyper edited videos that follow a script and have gay animations over them. \n\n You’ll get a dopamine rush and think you’re doing something useful. \n\n But you’ll never actually find success because you’re type one. \n\n You need everything to be predictable – which is the opposite of entrepreneurship. \n\n On the contrary, if you understand that anything worth having takes time and that your reality lies on your shoulders alone, you will eventually achieve your desired result. \n\n And when you consume information that reminds you of this, instead of getting angry that you weren’t handed an “A-Z blueprint” you’ll feel inspired that others see the world the same way you do. \n\n Every day you have the power to choose which of these two people you want to be. \n\n One will serve you and push you towards your goals. \n\n And the other will keep you stuck in the same mindset that has gotten you nowhere. \n\n Choose wisely. \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

    "body": "Happy Saturday {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n It’s been rainy and gloomy here in Miami for the past few days. \n\n The sky is white right now but there’s no rain coming down so I’m sitting on my balcony as I write this to you. \n\n Over the last few days I’ve really noticed how the weather impacts my mood. \n\n I’m a firm believer that 99% of problems can be fixed with a long walk in the sun. \n\n When it was constantly raining and I was unable to do so, I started to go crazy. \n\n Anyway it’s unusually quiet for a Saturday in the middle of Brickell. \n\n Usually there's this dude who bikes around carrying a beat box. \n\n He’ll stop on random street corners and start break dancing. \n\n Imagine you’re hungover at 8am on a Saturday and you’re woken up by a Bad Bunny song. \n\n You get up, walk out onto your balcony and see some guy with pink hair and the shape of a heart on the back of his head. \n\n He's blasting music and dancing like a freak. \n\n You’d probably try to snipe him right? \n\n I tried once but hit an old lady by accident. \n\n Maybe someone finally got him because it’s quiet today. \n\n Anyway, the other day I hosted a group call inside of Copy MBA. \n\n Someone asked a question about “writers block” when first starting out. \n\n Whether you want to build a copywriting business and you’re trying to practice, or you just want to start writing in general, this is inevitable. \n\n This student was trying to write a sample email for this supplement brand, but whenever he opens a google doc, he stares at a blinking cursor and eventually closes his laptop. \n\n Happens. \n\n I asked him what sport he played growing up. \n\n He told me he does mixed martial arts so I recommended that he find someone who is selling MMA courses or pick a clothing brand in that space and write for that instead. \n\n The reason this is effective is because it’s much easier to write about things you’d be in the market for. \n\n Especially when you’re first starting out. \n\n When I started, I was writing copy for basketball trainers. \n\n In every email, every ad, and every funnel I built – I was writing to my previous self. \n\n I understood the pain points and desires of the market because I was the market. \n\n And this made practicing 100x easier. \n\n Between this and building the habit of writing every day, I got better quickly. \n\n If you want to get better at copy, you need to write for fun. \n\n Start journaling. \n\n Start tweeting. \n\n Write a love letter to your ex. \n\n Go sit down in a coffee shop and write about the barista that held eye contact for too long when taking your order. \n\n Write about the idiot who’s standing in the middle of the doorway. \n\n Write about the poor bastard who passes by on a scooter in work clothes with a backpack on. \n\n Describe what you see in detail. \n\n Make it entertaining and don’t hold back \n\n Just write. \n\n It will make your life better. And eventually, you’ll be half decent at it. \n\n Alrighty I’m going to the gym. \n\n Let me know if you liked this one, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I posted a free 30 minute live call on Youtube where I map out the launch of a coaching program. \n\n ​ Check it out here. ​ \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

Pitches in every digital inbox I own. \n\n Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Gmail, even Venmo… \n\n People on the internet are constantly trying to get me to buy their services through cold outreach. \n\n And my audience isn’t even that big. \n\n 99% of the outbound messages I read are absolute trash. \n\n With every word they are showing more incompetence and only proving to be someone who I don’t want to work with. \n\n They barely do any research on me or what I could potentially need, their messages are too long, they sound retarded, etc. \n\n But honestly, it’s not their fault. \n\n Outreach USED to be a numbers game. \n\n If you blindly send enough cold DM’s, eventually you’ll get a client. \n\n It doesn’t work like that anymore (especially if you want to get GOOD clients that will pay you a decent retainer). \n\n Your success is now correlated to the quality of your message and the way you are perceived online. \n\n Yes, volume still matters. \n\n But failing to put yourself in a more credible position before doing outreach is like DMing Instagram models when you have 29 followers and one picture of yourself holding a fish. \n\n Not gonna work. \n\n There are three things you can do that will improve your online perception, thus increasing the likelihood you get replies to your cold pitches. \n\n 1. Post content \n\n 2. Lead with material that proves competence \n\n 3. Network \n\n The first point (content) is self explanatory. \n\n If you’re a beginner I understand that it may be difficult to know where to start in that regard. \n\n But I’m not just talking about video content or even posting information related to what you’re pitching. \n\n If you look like a normal, cool person on Instagram, you will get more responses. \n\n Simple. \n\n This second element (material that proves competence) is absolutely crucial as well. \n\n I get pitches with shitty sample emails and clips from my videos. \n\n The time put into these assets is meaningless if they suck. \n\n If they don’t suck, they get a reply. \n\n Last element – network (without being a dork). \n\n Everyone is more likely to respond to someone they have mutuals with. \n\n Strangers don’t get replies. They stay poor for eternity. \n\n Friends do business together. \n\n Got it? \n\n Stop spraying and praying. \n\n Use the three principles of online credibility above, and your chances of landing clients will greatly increase (and now it becomes a numbers game). \n\n Hope this helps – go show some love on this new video if it did :) ​ \n\n Please stop pitching me, \n\n Ben \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

I’m launching something cool next week. You’ll get one on one access to me, a private network, and content I don’t share elsewhere. \n\n Since you’re on this list you’ll have the opportunity to get in before I launch it publicly. \n\n Hit reply and say “Yes” if you’re interested and I’ll add you to the waitlist. \n\n ​\n​ \n\n ​",

It’s not an identity.\" \n\n I'll never be someone who tells you not to make as much money as possible. \n\n But just remember to continuously audit the path you're on and ensure it aligns with what you want. \n\n And whatever path you choose -- follow it with conviction. ​\n\n Talk later, \n\n Ben \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

Learn high income skills \n\n 2. Use social media to build a network \n\n 3. Build a personal brand \n\n Those three assets turn you into a weapon. \n\n The first step (learning skills) is simple. \n\n Simply learn copywriting and sales and you’re in better shape than 99% of people. \n\n Watch Youtube videos, pitch strangers on the internet, learn more on the fly. \n\n Step two (building a network by being a normal cool person) opens doors and gives you a safety net. \n\n If you can just start to connect with more people who are on a similar path as you (or ahead of you) opportunities flow your way. \n\n The best way I’ve found to do this has been through Twitter and by joining mastermind and coaching programs. \n\n And lastly, step three (personal brand) is perhaps the most valuable resource you can build in 2024. \n\n Now, not everyone is meant to have tens or hundreds of thousands of followers. \n\n But that doesn’t mean that you can’t share some insights on social media and utilize the platform. \n\n This goes hand and hand with networking in step two. \n\n Even if you don’t end up building a huge personal brand, posting content online can only help you. \n\n All three of these things will give you security and the best safety net possible if things ever go south. \n\n It’s the peace of mind that a college degree is supposed to give you. \n\n Let me know if you liked this one :) \n\n Btw I have something really cool for you launching this week and I’m excited to share it with you. \n\n Talk soon, \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​ \n\n ​",

Swishes only.” \n\n I think to myself “this mf crazy, I need a new trainer.” \n\n But I keep shooting, now aiming only for nylon. \n\n The ball hits the back of the rim and goes in. Doesn’t count. \n\n Front rim. Side rim. Rattles in off the glass. \n\n Doesn’t matter, I’m running. \n\n “This is ridiculous. I’m literally making these shots and still being forced to run,” I complain to myself. \n\n But then something cool happens. \n\n I find the sweet spot and the ball stops hitting the rim. \n\n The way I’m shooting feels different now. \n\n I’m no longer just aiming for the basket. \n\n I’m aiming for a very specific part of the back of the net. \n\n I’m conscious of exactly how the ball has to leave my fingertips. \n\n Everything is incredibly precise. \n\n I’ve reached a level of attention to detail and focus that I wasn’t accessing previously. \n\n This is the difference between good and great. \n\n It’s what keeps some business owners stuck at $10k, $50k, or $100k per month. \n\n It’s what causes tens of thousands of dollars worth of leads to fall through the cracks in a sales process. \n\n And it’s what created the opportunity for me to make 7 figures as a marketer for info-product businesses. \n\n I get paid to fill in the gaps. \n\n To improve the copy, or the sales process, or the video script. \n\n I bring a new level of attention to minor details and make an extra 6 figures a month for my clients. \n\n They pay me a percentage of it. \n\n This is how you win as a service provider for coaching business. \n\n Find the broken piece(s) of their business. \n\n Identify a solution using your critical thinking ability. \n\n Get paid. \n\n For example if an usually low amount of leads end up on sales calls, my job is to find the crack in the system. \n\n Maybe the email sequence sucks or there’s none at all. \n\n Maybe the leads aren’t getting dialed. \n\n Maybe the video sales letter is horrible. \n\n Maybe there’s a lack of congruence between the content and the messaging on the funnel. \n\n Whatever the problem is, the way to make money is to identify and fix it. \n\n Boom, now you’re a valuable piece to any coaching business. \n\n You’re turning good, into great. \n\n ​ Congrats, that’s how the money is made. ​ \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I'm in the process of building a course and community called The Artisan Lab. \n\n Because you're on this list, you'll have access to it before I promote it publicly (and at the lowest price). \n\n It's made up of the 3 pillars: \n\n Self, skillset, and social. \n\n Anyone who wants to increase their income and build their dream lifestyle needs to master those 3 things. \n\n If you're building a similar business to mine or if you want to direct access to me and my network, this will be a game changer for you. \n\n Excited to share it with you in the coming days. \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "“I would much rather fail gloriously than not try. I’m not interested in telling stories with competence. I’m looking to tell them with some style, originality, and creativity.” - Anthony Bourdain \n\n Happy Saturday {{ subscriber.first_name }}. \n\n The other day I was on a 90-foot yacht for the 4th of July, having a brief conversation with a friend about YouTube. \n\n A few years ago, he had 27k subscribers but wasn’t making any money from his channel. \n\n Then he got a piece of advice that changed his life forever. \n\n In passing, one of the biggest YouTubers in the world told him to change the thumbnail on a video he’d posted 6 months prior. \n\n So, he paid someone $10 to take a new thumbnail photo and uploaded it. \n\n Over the following 24 hours he went from 27k subs to over 100k and quit his job at Subway. \n\n He eventually reached over 1m subscribers before his channel was banned by the platform (you might know who I’m talking about here lol). \n\n What’s crazy to me is that all happened because of one small adjustment. \n\n Here’s how this pertains to you: \n\n A single decision can completely change your life. \n\n It could be a seemingly miniscule decision that you don’t give much thought to. \n\n It could be a risk or hail mary attempt that leads to a big break. \n\n Or it could be the decision to power through a tough time and change a behavior. \n\n Genuinely, sit there and think about this for a second. \n\n You are one decision away from everything you could ever dream of. \n\n Right now, you don’t know what that decision is. \n\n Odds are, you won’t know the ripple effect that it’ll create even when you make it. \n\n But if you keep throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping that it sticks, eventually it will. \n\n Maybe you’ll have to get creative and change from spaghetti to penne, or marinara to alfredo. \n\n Maybe Anthony Bourdain will descend from heaven and casually tell you to add a single ingredient that makes it stick. \n\n Or maybe you just have to keep throwing it over and over, past the point that you would usually quit. \n\n One day, it will stick. \n\n The culmination of all of your formerly unrewarded effort will be paid back 10 fold in an instant. \n\n To others, you’ll appear to be an overnight success. \n\n But you’ll know that’s not the case. \n\n It was a result of tens, hundreds, or thousands of decisions and repetitions… \n\n Plus a disdain for the run of the mill, competent effort. \n\n Eventually, it works. \n\n Keep firing, and test the occasional aberrant idea. \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Let me know if you liked this one. \n\n Someone recently left a comment on a video of mine saying “Anthony Bourdain energy.” \n\n I was somehow unfamiliar with Anthony until then and just watched this video where I got that quote in the beginning of the email. \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "I have a superpower. \n\n It's a singular strength I’ve really developed over the last few years. \n\n It’s helped me in my personal life, business, and social media. \n\n It seems to have made me more likable and has played a role in client acquisition and results. \n\n Meaning it’s the reason people buy things. \n\n And it’s probably the same reason you like my content (unless you hate it and you’re just here to talk shit in my replies). \n\n The cool thing about this superpower, is it’s something you have too. \n\n Maybe you’re accessing it right now, maybe you’re not. \n\n But I think it’s one of the key factors in finding success in all the above domains. \n\n “Ok Ben, I get it, this thing is important. Now would you tell me what it is???” \n\n No. \n\n Don’t you understand? \n\n Right now, you’re either using your superpower or you’re not. \n\n You’re either hearing me, or you’re not. \n\n And that’s the secret. \n\n My superpower is I listen. \n\n I listen to others when they talk. Not just what they say, but what they mean. \n\n When my girl says “it’s fine” I know that’s code for “you fucked up but I’m not telling you what you did, so you have to figure it out.” \n\n When a prospect tells me about their business, I put myself in their shoes. \n\n I think about their motives, desires and roadblocks. \n\n And I assess their situation as objectively as I can. \n\n This is obviously a huge part of copywriting and sales. It’s having the empathy to prescribe the right solution to a certain problem. \n\n And if you don’t listen, you won’t be in tune with the problem. \n\n Furthermore I listen to myself. \n\n What do I actually want? \n\n Why am I doing or not doing a certain thing? \n\n Are my actions in alignment with what I say I want? And if not, am I willing to change? \n\n I honestly think my habit to intellectualize my life is a blessing and curse. \n\n It keeps me quite in touch with the underlying narratives going through my head. \n\n Which helps me create content that feels really personal. \n\n If it’s ever felt like I’m articulating an exact problem you have, and the way you think about it, this is why. \n\n But sometimes it also stops me from taking action as quickly as I should. \n\n Two sides to every coin I guess. \n\n Anyway - listen more. \n\n Stop jumping to conclusions. \n\n Get off your high horse. \n\n And do your best to be empathetic. Both with others and with yourself. \n\n Remember - you’re one decision away from turning everything around. ​\n\n Talk tomorrow, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. My community, the Artisan Lab is in the works and launching soon. \n\n If you want to learn from me in any capacity this is gonna be for you. \n\n Plus it should be a really dope “networking” opportunity if you want to meet more people in the online money space who aren’t dorks. \n\n Excited to let you in :) \n\n ​\n​",

    "body": "Yo {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Let’s talk about data. \n\n Personally, I hate numbers. \n\n I cheated in every math class I ever took. \n\n But sometimes only data can reveal a clear answer when things are stagnant or you’re not getting a result you want. \n\n This can be quite obvious when looking at quantifiable data. \n\n If you’re spending $10k on ads and only making $5k back, clearly there's an issue. \n\n Any reasonable person who doesn’t want to lose money would then try to figure out the problem. \n\n To do this, they’d look at the more granular data. \n\n The click through rate, cost per click, cost per impressions, conversion rate, etc. \n\n Using this data, they’d attempt to identify the problem and test a solution. \n\n Rinse and repeat. \n\n This is a pragmatic, data-driven approach that will result in objective truths. \n\n And if you’re not progressing in a certain area of your life the way you want to, this is what you need to apply. \n\n Let’s say you’ve been trying to put on muscle for 6 months. \n\n Your approach hasn’t been very meticulous and you stepped on the scale today and saw that you’ve only gained 2 pounds. \n\n As a sensible person, capable of critical thought, what would you do in this scenario? \n\n Answer in your head real quick. \n\n If you said something along the lines of “I’d audit what I’m eating and how I’m working out, and see what needs to be changed,” you’ve come up with a solid answer. \n\n Now for whatever reason, this ability to analyze data gets forgotten when the data is less quantifiable. \n\n Meaning if you’ve been in a situation you don’t like for an extended period of time. \n\n Whether it’s: \n\n Trying to start a business and not making much progress \n\n Stagnating in your business \n\n Lack of growth on social media \n\n Or even in your personal life: \n\n Maybe you’ve been wanting to improve a relationship, you’ve had a list of hobbies that you wanted to try but haven’t, or you want to build better habits… \n\n Whatever that thing is, you eventually need to take an objective look under the hood. \n\n “Why am I not solving this problem I have? What are the variables that go into the problem? If I were to solve this problem, what would need to change?” \n\n And just like that, you’ve given yourself action steps to execute on. \n\n Don’t forget to look at the data in your life and perform mini-audits. \n\n Be pragmatic, and find the objective truth. \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. I finished recording the last few modules of the Artisan Lab today. \n\n It has basically become a digital version of my brain. \n\n Here’s some of the info inside: \n\n How I’ve built my agency to 6 figures/month How we’ve scaled info businesses to $500k/month+ My full copywriting guide I’ve used to generate millions The daily habits & routine that took me from being an average college kid to successful entrepreneur Plus a lot more. \n\n Thinking about launching it in the next couple days.

Keep an eye out for my next email and I'll see you on the inside :) \n\n Talk soon, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

    "body": "Gm. \n\n I forgot to write to you yesterday. \n\n Not because I don’t love you (I do). \n\n But because I was quite busy. \n\n I had a few one-on-ones with new members of my mastermind, I boxed with my trainer, and I brought in a special guest to do a group call with my community. \n\n Then I was scrolling through Tik Tok and saw a creator with a huge audience and a really ugly funnel. \n\n He probably had some 18 year old kid who calls himself a “growth operator” set it up for him. \n\n It was a $27/month Skool community. \n\n Now listen, I haven't sent an outbound dm since you were in diapers. \n\n You’re probably around the same age as me, so that was a really long time ago. \n\n But this guy was sitting on such an opportunity and I was so disgusted to see it being squandered. \n\n So, I ran into my office and made him a loom video pitch. \n\n It took me 2 seconds to find his email, I wrote a few lines of copy and sent the loom. \n\n Using my little spy tool, I saw he opened it instantly. \n\n Then I got a notification that “someone” watched my video. \n\n He didn’t reply yet, but he went over to my instagram and followed me. \n\n We’ll see. I honestly don’t care if he closes or not. \n\n But it’d be really cool if I could flex on all of you who’ve been doing outreach for a while. \n\n Imagine you’re working your ass off sending 30 pitches a day. \n\n And then you see me, scrolling through tik tok in my pajamas when I find your ideal client. \n\n I open my laptop, click the loom button and start rambling about how we’ve made a lot of clients a lot of moneys. \n\n Next thing you know I’m on a call with your ideal client and he loves me. \n\n We talk about the weather and he tells me about his favorite spots in Miami when he was my age. \n\n I show him the keys to my Porsche 911 turbo and then tell him I can help him make the equivalent of 3 of them in a month. \n\n He’s wowed. \n\n I pitch a price 100x the average growth operator or copywriters net worth. \n\n He says “YES!!!” and asks if he can add a tip. \n\n I receive the wire on the call, my team builds him a new funnel, and we make him $1m next month. \n\n Hahahaha. \n\n That would be cool. \n\n I shared this whole outbound process (including the loom and email I sent) inside the Artisan Lab btw. ​\n\n I didn’t expect to write a rather arrogant email to you today, but here we are. \n\n It would also be funny if this whole thing blew up in my face. \n\n I’ll keep you updated. \n\n This inspired me to start doing outbound again. It’s kind of fun. \n\n Anyway, you can apply to join my mastermind here if you want to get a behind the scenes look at it all. ​\n\n Talk to you tomorrow, \n\n Ben\n​ \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "In yesterdays email I told you how I sent my first outbound pitch since the Vietnam war. \n\n A lot of people replied, so I figured I'd give you a quick update. \n\n I had an hour long sales call yesterday afternoon with the prospect and his assistant. \n\n He had actually replied to my email 30 minutes after I sent it but it went to my requests on instagram so I didn't see it immediately. \n\n Regardless, we ended up on a zoom. \n\n I was sitting at the desk you see me at in my Youtube videos and he noticed the keyboard behind me. \n\n So I played a verse of Beethovens' Fur Elise . \n\n Not joking. \n\n Then we chatted for a while and I broke down how I'd help him make a lot more money. \n\n The guy has grown to over a quarter million followers on both TikTok and Instagram from scratch after starting in April. \n\n Which is absolutely crazy growth and a perfect opportunity for someone like me to come into. \n\n We hopped off the call, I sent a proposal over and we'll touch base Monday. \n\n This cold outreach thing is kind of fun(?) \n\n Idk why I've been hating on it for the last two years lol. \n\n Anyway I've been documenting this whole process inside my mastermind. \n\n From what I said in the loom video pitch, to the email I sent which got almost an instant reply. \n\n I even shared the 4 page proposal that I wrote with everything I'd do to help him get to multi-six figures per month. \n\n The Artisan Lab members have been able to see the whole process. \n\n That should give you FOMO. \n\n Actually, I have an idea. \n\n I'm chilling here on the couch on this beautiful Friday evening and don't have much to do. \n\n If you're interested in joining the Artisan Lab and have some money to invest in coaching... \n\n DM me the word \"Artisan\" on Instagram here and I'll personally reply and answer any questions you have about the mastermind. \n\n I promise it'll be me and not an appointment setter or anything. \n\n Here's an unsolicited POV of me right now for proof: \n\n ​ ​ DM me \"Info\" on IG and let's chat. ​ \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n\n ​",

    "body": "A lot has changed since the last email I sent to you. \n\n First, I moved. \n\n Here’s my new POV as I begin writing to you: \n\n ​ I’m now 80 something floors up with the water view you see above. \n\n It’s much more peaceful than being in the middle of the city (and better than being on a poverty floor under the clouds). \n\n I was reminded of a very valuable lesson during this move. \n\n You see, I’m the type of guy that does everything last minute. \n\n ESPECIALLY if it’s something trivial or a task I don’t want to do. \n\n So I waited until 6pm on the day before I was supposed to move to start clicking around on the internet to find a moving company. \n\n I filled out a few forms to get quotes and assumed they’d reach out within a day or two. \n\n Next thing you know, I get a call from a local number. \n\n Keep in mind, it’s Sunday at 7:24pm EST, less than an hour after I filled out the form. \n\n Some kind woman is on the other end with the moving company and she tells me she can send movers as early as tomorrow. \n\n I’m sold. \n\n I don’t care about the price. \n\n I don’t care to get quotes from other companies. \n\n I had a problem and this woman Kathy (not her real name but she sounded like a Kathy) extinguished that problem quickly. \n\n That’s the lesson. \n\n If you’re selling agency services or coaching, or literally anything… \n\n MOVE FASTER. \n\n I’ve personally lost deals because I was too slow or wasn’t “available” until a few days later. \n\n By then the urgency is gone. \n\n And the pain that comes with a fresh problem is diminished, meaning getting the sale is gonna be harder. \n\n This is why it’s a good rule of thumb to have a sales team that dials every lead immediately (if you run a coaching business and you’re not doing this, that means you enjoy poverty). \n\n One of the first lessons I was taught when I started running ads for local basketball trainers 4 years ago, was “speed = lead.” \n\n I was in this coaching program and my coach told me to drill this message into the heads of my clients. \n\n My job was to get them leads, but if they don’t contact those leads ASAP, then they’re throwing money down a furnace. \n\n As you know, business is just a game of solving problems. \n\n The bigger problems you solve and the faster you can do so, the more money you make. \n\n The first moving company that called me late on a Sunday got my business and charged me $1,200 to move me 5 minutes down the street. \n\n Maybe there was a cheaper option. \n\n But the problem was resolved and I’m happy to pay a premium for the efficiency. \n\n ​ Don’t be slow or you’ll get left behind. ​ \n\n Ben \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

Talk about what you find interesting. Talk about why you’re poor. Talk about your dog, or your girl, or your obsession with sports betting. \n\n Just don’t say the N word or call fat people disgusting hippos. \n\n You’ll be glad you started. \n\n ​ Get access to the next guest speaker call by going here. ​\n\n Bye, \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​ \n\n ​",

And you’re still here, so that means maybe you’re having fun with me. \n\n I’ve never deliberately “practiced” my copywriting ability, I just wrote. \n\n I started sending emails to this list in September 2021. \n\n There were probably 6 people who’d subscribed, including my 4 burner emails, my mother, and grandma. \n\n On top of that, I was effectively an autistic Chinese child who didn’t speak a word of English (if that offended you, grow up). \n\n I had no idea what I was talking about, nothing to sell, and very few people who cared to listen to what I was saying. \n\n But I started anyway. \n\n I developed my own style, my writing became more clear, and I began articulating the ideas that were rattling around in my head. \n\n Along with the newsletter, I was consistently tweeting and journaling. \n\n This was the “training camp” that prepared me to work with clients. \n\n I’d read a few copywriting books, I practiced every day (even though it didn’t feel like practice), and I became half-decent at this writing thing. \n\n It’d be impossible not to. \n\n One of my favorite copywriting books is The Boron Letters by Gary Halbert. \n\n The reason I like it is because it feels personal (he wrote it to his son while he was in jail). \n\n Instead of writing in a super authoritative tone, it reads as if it’s a journal with insights and tips sprinkled throughout. \n\n You can tell he clearly enjoys writing and isn’t putting any pressure on himself to be grammatically correct or follow any rules. \n\n This is how you have to practice. \n\n Write about your day. \n\n Write about something you enjoy. \n\n Write about how you overcame a difficult time in your life. \n\n Write about the weird crush you have on your cleaning lady (creep). \n\n It doesn’t matter what you write about, as long as you find a way to enjoy it, and it doesn’t feel like work. \n\n Ok? \n\n Ok. \n\n Enough for today. \n\n ​ Join me in the Artisan Lab if you want to get rich. ​\n\n If you don’t want to join me in there, that’s fine. But at least reply and tell me you made it all the way down here to make me feel good. \n\n Thanks, \n\n Ben \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

Start today if you haven't. \n\n The second thing is walking. \n\n What better way to clear your head? \n\n It’s literally impossible to be sad when the sun is shining and birds are chirping. \n\n I could watch my best friend get eaten by a lizard but if it’s a nice day I’ll get over it. \n\n Ok maybe that’s an exaggeration. \n\n Back to the point. \n\n On my walk in the sun this morning, I thought about my life. \n\n I realized that success comes in waves. \n\n There will be times where I can pull out my phone, make a minute long video and get a million views. \n\n And there will be times where I feel like I’m spewing gold into the camera only for a couple thousand people to even see it. \n\n Every wave eventually crashes. \n\n But the ocean never stops moving. \n\n Your time will come. \n\n And if you’re riding a wave right now, get as much as you can out of it. \n\n Last thing: \n\n I also realized how ungrateful I was being by complaining about metrics. \n\n People leave comments and reply to my emails telling me how much I’ve impacted their lives, but I’m unhappy because the views are down? \n\n What a bitch. \n\n Do not take for granted what you have, just because you want more. \n\n Greed will make you lose it all. \n\n I appreciate you {{ subscriber.first_name }}. \n\n Thank you for reading my emails and engaging with my content. \n\n I’ll stop taking you for granted. \n\n Have a great day, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S.

I’m just excited to talk to you. \n\n Hope you’re having an amazing Thursday morning. \n\n What do you want to talk about today? \n\n Oh, I got something. \n\n Decisions. \n\n Isn’t it crazy how our entire reality is shaped by countless micro decisions we’re making on a daily basis? \n\n Like you could just wake up one day and start speaking with a British accent. \n\n Or you could simply decide to stop being poor and take the actions necessary to make money. \n\n Orrr you could decide to stop pulling out and build an NFL team of babies. \n\n Everyday you choose to either take actions that will further align you with the person you want to be, or do the opposite. \n\n When you open your laptop and the voice in your head tells you that you need to scroll through TikTok for a minute before starting work – can you shut it out or do you give in? \n\n Because you know ‘one minute’ usually turns into three hours. \n\n You simply cannot compete with the Chinese artificial intelligence algorithm. \n\n They figured out, “Oh, all we have to do is show men titties and show women travel videos and Hermes bags and they just keep scrolling forever. Stupid little lizards.” \n\n Can you resist the double D’s and birkins? \n\n Or will you give in to the Chinese? \n\n Hahahah. \n\n Sorry I got carried away on that one. \n\n Recently I had to make a big decision. \n\n It was not easy but I knew that it would be better for me in the long run. \n\n My brain tried to do everything in its power to stop me. \n\n Because with this decision, much change would come. \n\n And that’s painful. \n\n Even days after I’d made up my mind, I’d still find myself trying to revert back to old habits. \n\n I quite literally had to view the voice in my head like a toddler. \n\n “No, you don’t actually want that. It’s just a narrative you’re telling yourself because it’s easier than the alternative.” \n\n I used logic to constantly remind myself that I was making the right call. \n\n And there was this underlying feeling in my gut that knew that was true. \n\n I’m telling you all this because I want you to make the right choices. \n\n You know what you need to do. \n\n You know what needs to change. \n\n And you know that further contemplation is just a way to occupy your brain so that you feel like you’re being productive. \n\n Don’t let the Chinese control you. \n\n Resist! \n\n ​ Lmao, ​ \n\n Ben\n​ \n\n ​",

Don’t waste your luck. \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Join me in the Artisan lab here. ​ \n\n P.P.S. Lmk if you made it all the way down here, soldier. \n\n ​\n​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "Happy Monday. \n\n On my walk this morning I overheard a guy talking about the hospitality industry. \n\n It sounds like times are tough right now. \n\n A friend of mine who works in nightlife told me the same thing recently. \n\n Allegedly, a lot of the bigger clubs and restaurants are losing money. \n\n Like, lots of money. \n\n I began thinking about how complex it must be to run a hospitality group. \n\n Between staffing, opening new locations, logistics, operations and a myriad of other factors I’m probably overlooking. \n\n And then finally on top of all that, the most important piece; marketing. \n\n You have to deal with all of these annoying logistical issues and even once you solve all of them, you will still fail if you don’t get people in the doors. \n\n That does not sound like a fun time. \n\n Let’s compare this to an online service based business or coaching business. \n\n There are two main objectives in each of these. \n\n 1. Create an attractive, in-demand offer. \n\n 2. Generate demand. \n\n It’s actually the same process of building a club or restaurant, without the world of complexity attached to it. \n\n With an internet business, all you have to do is learn some skills and build the offer. \n\n That can take a week. \n\n And basically costs nothing. \n\n Once the offer is built, you can dedicate the majority of your focus to acquisition. \n\n If your content gets attention, or you build a lucrative outbound system, or you can profitably put a dollar into Facebook and get $2 back, scaling becomes easy. \n\n You double down on the acquisition system and you make sure nothing breaks on the backend. \n\n Next thing you know, you have a $5m/year business that was built off a couple TikTok videos, loom pitches, or cringy ads. \n\n Obviously I’m oversimplifying this a bit, but it really is this simple. \n\n You lose when you try to make it more complicated. \n\n If you’re struggling to grow as a service provider or a coach, one of two things are happening. \n\n 1. You’re focusing on the wrong things and distracting yourself from the actual needle movers. \n\n 2. You’re just really dumb. No offense, but you are cooked. I think McDonalds is hiring though. \n\n You might not realize it, but opportunity in the info-product space right now is similar to the way paid ads were 10-15 years ago. \n\n I was in diapers back then, but a friend of mine told me he was getting 1 cent cost per click on his ads. \n\n 1 cent. \n\n Meaning, holy fuck, you’re gonna get rich. \n\n But over time, that opportunity diminishes and it gets more expensive. \n\n Right now, in 2024 you can whip out your phone and make a 48 second selfie video that millions of people could see. \n\n If the content in the video is somewhat useful and you have an offer that correlates with it, you now have a seven figure business. \n\n I’m not exaggerating. \n\n Idiots are getting rich. \n\n ​ Do you want to join them? ​ \n\n Talk tomorrow, \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n\n ​",

Nobody’s gonna notice me anyway.” \n\n It’s an uphill battle and you have no idea where the top of the hill is. \n\n You just keep climbing and hope that eventually you find it, which isn’t guaranteed. \n\n You could climb for decades and still end up as one of the unknown actors who never found a good role. \n\n It’s a gamble. \n\n Maybe you’ll get lucky, maybe you won’t. \n\n However, there are ways that you can increase your chances. \n\n Consistency plus iteration creates luck. \n\n I think that's the smartest thing I’ve said all year. \n\n If you don’t quit and you continually strive to get better at the craft, you have a chance. \n\n Worst case scenario, it’s likely that your effort will result in an opportunity, even if it’s not the one you were anticipating. \n\n And best case scenario… \n\n ​ Well, the sky's the limit. ​\n\n Happy hunting, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Reply if you made it all the way down here :) \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

People can't comprehend how much you have to screw yourself over to get self respect.” - Brute \n\n It’s no secret that change is difficult. \n\n Changing your habits is painful. \n\n Changing your career path is painful. \n\n Changing your negative thought patterns is painful. \n\n Because of this, most people elect to endure situations that aren’t right for them in order to avoid the pain that comes with change. \n\n Sure, working a job you hate sucks, but quitting that job to bet on yourself would be temporarily more painful than staying in it. \n\n Your willingness to exchange this low level, long term pain for high level, short term pain is what makes you grow. \n\n You choose to dig the hole a little deeper. \n\n You choose to put yourself in a tough situation. \n\n You choose to sacrifice your (illusionary) peace for struggle. \n\n And then you’re free. \n\n It’ll be difficult and even after making the decision your ego will try to pull you back into comfort. \n\n But if you can withstand that tide, you’ll make it to the other side as a new person. \n\n Comfort kills you slowly.

    "body": "Around this time last year, I hit my first $100k month as a growth partner. \n\n If you’re completely new here, here’s how my business works in a nutshell: \n\n I partner with “influencers\" who sell courses (think trading influencer or eCom guru). \n\n I help them build a program from scratch or improve their current offer \n\n My team and I run all of their operations. \n\n From their sales funnels, to email marketing, automations, scripting videos, sales team, etc. \n\n My client's job is to make content. \n\n My job is to help them get the people who watch their content to buy their course. \n\n Make sense? \n\n I hope so, because I just explained that to you as if you’re an autistic monkey. \n\n Anyway, about 2 years ago, I was stuck between $10-20k per month. \n\n It was frustrating seeing people who I deemed incompetent make way more money than me. \n\n I was working really hard but just couldn’t get through that ceiling. \n\n And then, something changed. \n\n I hit $25k. \n\n Then $30k the next month. \n\n Then $35k. \n\n $50k. \n\n I hovered around $60k-80k for a bit. \n\n And then, I finally hit $100k. \n\n It was all because of one thing: \n\n Positioning. \n\n When I was stuck under $20k/month, I had no leverage. \n\n I would take any opportunity I could get. \n\n I was writing a ton of copy, building funnels, managing CRMs, and it all felt discombobulated. \n\n Every client I got basically felt like I had a boss telling me what to do. \n\n But then, I got one really good win. \n\n I helped a client go from $30k/month to $350k per month in 2 months. \n\n A couple months later we were past $500k/month. \n\n Not only did that result in a multiple 5 figure rev share for me, but it put me on the map. \n\n It changed the way I was perceived by others because I could flex that case study. \n\n And it changed the way I perceived myself because I saw my actions result in such a drastic impact. \n\n That singular win is all it took to give me endless opportunities, and the conviction I needed to be able to handle them. \n\n If you’re trying to build a copywriting or growth partner business right now, keep this in mind. \n\n Just get one fat W, and the floodgates will open my friend. \n\n Extrapolate this to any life pursuit you’re stagnating in. \n\n When it rains, it pours. \n\n ​ Come check out Artisan Lab if you want to learn from me directly. ​ \n\n Later, \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​",

    "body": "Let’s talk about money. \n\n When you’re a beginner, you typically think you need to find the right business model. \n\n In reality, it’s not the label that’s important. \n\n Whether you’re a copywriter, IPGA, IPO, growth operator, growth partner, etc. \n\n All of these terms are different ways to say the same thing. \n\n You offer ‘done for you’ services to online businesses. \n\n This is important to understand because a business model doesn’t make you money, your skillset does. \n\n People like me, Pierre Khoury, and others who’ve had success in this space have been able to do so because we can offer a multitude of services and truly increase revenue. \n\n It’s definitely NOT because of a fancy label we placed on our services. \n\n This brings me to my second point, which is that the market decides your niche. \n\n In my business, our biggest wins have come through webinars. \n\n It’s the main reason I’ve gotten to 6 figure months. \n\n But that happened on accident. \n\n We tested a webinar for a client and it worked. \n\n We figured we’d try it out for other clients and it kept working. \n\n That doesn’t mean that your business has to work the same way as mine. \n\n Your big wins could come through VSLs. \n\n Or you could figure out that you’re really good at scripting YT videos or short form content. \n\n Or maybe you end up specializing in email automations. \n\n My point here is that you’re a marketer, not a robot. \n\n If you label yourself as a growth operator and you’ll only work with creators who have an audience but don’t have an offer yet, your TAM (total addressable market) is limited. \n\n But if you drop the label and think of yourself as a marketer, you can fit into different roles. \n\n That’s how you get your foot in the door with a client (solve one niche problem they’re facing) and then you start to take over other pieces of their business. \n\n Get one big win, and you have a solidified offer. \n\n This doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s the best way to do it if you wanna work with coaches and course creators. \n\n Learn some skills, pitch a bunch of shit, see what works, double down. \n\n Now you’re rich. You’re welcome. \n\n ​ Go here if you want my help in growing your info-product agency or coaching business. ​\n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​",

Do I need to start taking viagra? Am I developing cataracts? \n\n Oh no. \n\n I’m going to New York with my friends Jimmy and Mason today. \n\n We have quite the weekend planned, but if I told you about it, I’d have to kill you. \n\n I don’t think I could ever live in NY. \n\n I have one major flaw and it’s that I’m geographically challenged. \n\n I don’t know what body of water I’m looking at off my balcony right now. \n\n I don’t know if I’m facing east, west, north, south, or upside down. \n\n I don’t know how to get nearly anywhere without a GPS. \n\n Miami is relatively small and I have a hard enough time navigating it. \n\n I can’t imagine how lost I’d be in New York. \n\n Plus I’d have a bunch of angry neurotic people yelling at me. \n\n Speaking of, the other day I watched a clip of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David. \n\n They were talking about Seinfeld, and how it was “a show about nothing.” \n\n This is an email about nothing. \n\n Well actually, I guess I do have something to tell you: \n\n Sorry. \n\n I’ve been slacking on Youtube. \n\n I was growing really quickly at first, then I hit a plateau, and got too caught up in the numbers. \n\n My focus went from “how can I make content that I enjoy?” \n\n To “how can I hook these stupid little lizard brained monkeys into watching more of my video so the algorithm pushes it?” \n\n And that took the fun out of it. \n\n I’m gonna get back on there and stop worrying about the metrics, I promise. \n\n But it might be a few days because there’s a solid chance I get lost in New York. \n\n Anyway, here’s my last thought for you today: \n\n You can always find a reason to stress when you tie your sense of self to your accomplishments. \n\n In that sense, you’ll never be complete. \n\n Sure, this can be a way to motivate yourself but it also stains every experience with jaded glasses. \n\n You’ll be in the club in New York with a dozen models around you and your favorite song playing as you dance with your best friends. \n\n But you won’t be all the way there. \n\n There will be a part of you that’s anxious, worrying about how you don’t have $100m yet. \n\n Instead, learn to accept what is. \n\n You’re on your journey and that’s that. \n\n Stressing doesn’t fix anything, so you might as well be where you are. \n\n Congrats. You’ve completed this email about nothing. \n\n Let me know if you made it all the way down here. \n\n See you in NY, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Join my mastermind here. ​\n\n ​ \n\n ​ \n\n ​\n​",

Learn copywriting \n\n Read books, watch Youtube videos, and start writing sample copy. \n\n You can improve quickly, you just have to get reps. \n\n Writing on Twitter or pretending you have your own email list can also be helpful. \n\n Study good copy and your subconscious will recognize patterns. \n\n But DO NOT overthink this. \n\n You don’t have to be the best writer in the world, you just have to be competent. \n\n 2. Start outreach \n\n Start before you feel 100% ready, as most learning is done on the fly. \n\n Go through social media, find people that are selling coaching and pitch them. \n\n Just don’t be an idiot and copy what everyone else tells you to do. \n\n This part is a grind but the bar is low because everyone else is dumb. \n\n If you send a good pitch, you have a chance. \n\n I’ve literally sent one outbound pitch this entire year and it landed me a 5 figure deal. \n\n 3. Just say yes \n\n If you understand copywriting, learning other skills is easy. \n\n I could teach you how to write a VSL in 10 minutes. \n\n Same with managing CRMs, automations, and literally any other relevant skill. \n\n Just because you haven’t done something before doesn’t mean you’re not one Google search away. \n\n If you get an opportunity, take it. \n\n That’s literally how I learned everything. \n\n A client would come to me with a need, I’d say “yes I can do that” and boom, I figured it out. \n\n It’s really that simple. \n\n Just don’t get distracted along the way. \n\n ​ If you want my personal coaching in your own journey to wealth, go here. ​\n\n Deuces, \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​ \n\n ​",

Email copywriting \n\n 2. VSL scripting and funnel build \n\n 3. Short form scripts \n\n Those are all easy to learn and they get your foot in the door. \n\n You can get an upfront fee or a retainer to start. \n\n Once that goes well, you then start to offer other services and take over more elements to your clients business. \n\n Two years ago, I hit my first $25k month doing exactly this. \n\n I didn’t have any big “whale\" clients. \n\n It consisted of a few email retainers, and I closed a couple clients that needed new VSL funnels. \n\n I went above and beyond for my clients, and that’s how I eventually got rev shares. \n\n The point I’m trying to make here is this: \n\n Do not put yourself in a box. \n\n Pitch email retainers, VSLs, scripts, funnels, etc. \n\n Once you get some experience, you'll have more leverage. \n\n That's when you can get rev shares. \n\n By then you'll have results to show for, and actually become a skilled marketer. \n\n Skills last forever, “business models” do not. \n\n ​ Join me over here if you’re ready to build your Info-product agency. ​ \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​",

    "body": "I did a Q&A yesterday on new business Instagram (follow here). \n\n There were too many questions to get through all of them on IG, so I’ll be answering more here. \n\n Let’s get it: \n\n What’s something about you that hasn’t changed after being financially free? \n\n Nothing. \n\n Money doesn’t change you, it serves as a tool that allows you to be more of who you already were. \n\n I’ve become more comfortable expressing my true self as I’ve had financial success. \n\n It was always there, I just didn’t have the confidence to show it until I proved to myself that I could design my life however I wanted. \n\n Did your college friends get what you were doing at the time you dropped out? \n\n Sort of. \n\n They didn’t know all the details, but they knew I was running some form of marketing business. \n\n Not to throw shade at all, but I was actually surprised how few of them were curious enough to ask. \n\n Once they graduated and started normal jobs, more have reached out asking for info. \n\n Do you do low and high ticket offers with your clients that make over $100k/month? \n\n Almost all high ticket offers. \n\n In 95% of cases, having a low ticket offer is quite dumb. \n\n Only caveats are when its purpose is to liquidate ad spend, the personal brand has a huge audience, or the offer doesn’t have a direct ROI (teaching a hobby). \n\n How do you lock in and work when you don’t feel like it? \n\n I’ve always been horrible at doing things I don’t want to do. \n\n But my biggest leaps in business have been made when I can get over that initial resistance. \n\n Starting anything from scratch is difficult. \n\n That’s natural. If you expect it to be easy, you’ll quit. \n\n But on the other side of resistance, you start moving with the tide. \n\n The work starts to feel like peace and you develop this love for progress. \n\n It’s one of the most beautiful emotional states that you can access in life. \n\n But you have to earn it by getting over that resistance in the beginning. \n\n So either do the work, or be a pussy forever lol. \n\n Ok last one - there were a bunch of questions about doing outreach. \n\n And this is the problem. \n\n You’re looking for an “outreach system.” \n\n This is why every pitch I see absolutely sucks. \n\n You’re trying to rush the process as if you’re attempting to get a girl to go home with you 3 minutes into a date. \n\n It’s creepy and you didn’t demonstrate any value or status. \n\n Why would someone trust you? \n\n The only outreach tip you’ll ever need is to use your brain. \n\n If you’re competent, you’ll figure out a way to get in touch with people. \n\n If you’re not, well someones gotta flip the burgers. \n\n I know that’s a bit harsh but it’s the truth. \n\n Thanks again for all the questions, sorry if I didn’t get to yours. \n\n ​ Anyway, check out this new interview I did with Sean, one of my mastermind members. ​ \n\n He’s making $30k/mo working with some big names like Charlie Morgan and Joel Kaplan. \n\n See you over there, \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​",

Hope you’re doing well!” \n\n “You too, {{ subscriber.first_name }}!” \n\n Yeah, that shit needs to stop. \n\n If you go two years where your texts with someone only consist of birthday wishes, lets just all agree to end it there. \n\n Ok? \n\n Good. \n\n This sounds like a Seinfeld bit. \n\n Anyway, I’ve now written 120 words without saying anything of value. \n\n The biggest lesson I internalized in my 23rd year of life is that there is no rulebook. \n\n You can truly live however you want. \n\n Which is freeing, yet terrifying. \n\n I don’t think most people want to accept that truth. \n\n Because then, you become the author. \n\n You have to take everything into your own hands, and make your own rules. \n\n It’s easier to follow the standard of those around you. \n\n I ‘side quested’ a lot over the past 12 months. \n\n I started hobbies and pursuits that didn’t impact the number in my bank account, but felt right. \n\n In these quests, I learned a lot about myself and became more comfortable showing who I am. \n\n Although this didn’t push me ahead in this imaginary game we’re all playing, it made me feel like I’m winning. \n\n It’s my own game, with my own rules and scoreboard. \n\n I learned that I could decide what I wanted and go get it. \n\n There’ve been challenges, twists, turns, and everything in between. \n\n It’s been a fun year, but not an easy one – although it may look that way on social media. \n\n But maybe that’s the goal? \n\n Life will always come with roadblocks and hurdles, but as long as they are conducive to a mission that is your own, that’s okay. \n\n You don’t want to lose yourself fighting someone else’s battle. \n\n As Dostoevsky said, “Your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing.” \n\n You have to continuously and intentionally grab life by the balls. \n\n Design the reality you want. \n\n And the hardships that come with it are building you into the character who is capable of accepting it. \n\n ​ Just keep moving, ​ \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​",

    "body": "Good morning, {{ subscriber.first_name }}. \n\n You know, success is really simple. \n\n There are only two things you actually need. \n\n Everything else is just noise. \n\n The first thing is you have to be smart… enough. \n\n Being smart enough doesn’t mean you’re wicked smart. \n\n It means you can walk and talk at the same time. \n\n It means you can figure out how to use Google when you don’t have an answer. \n\n It means you can consume simple information and understand it. \n\n 90% of people I meet are smart enough. \n\n The problem is most people doubt themselves. \n\n They feel unprepared to start. \n\n They over contemplate every potential action. \n\n They think success is supposed to be difficult, so they avoid taking the obvious actions that will push them towards their goals. \n\n So sure, you have to be smart enough – but you also have to be dumb enough to trust yourself. \n\n The second element of success is this: \n\n You have to consistently work. \n\n Notice how I didn’t say work hard. \n\n But literally just work consistently. \n\n Genuinely, making your first $10k online isn’t difficult. \n\n Even making $100k in a month isn’t difficult once you’re in the right position. \n\n It’s just a battle of distractions. \n\n Can you consistently take one or two actions daily over an extended period of time? \n\n Or will you get distracted, discouraged, or lose ‘motivation’ and tell yourself you need to find something you’re more passionate about? \n\n If you can resist the latter, eventually you win. \n\n And this doesn’t mean you’re going “balls the wall” working 16 hour days. \n\n But rather that you’ve identified your highest ROI tasks and committed to them. \n\n For example, say you want to build an info-product agency. \n\n Once you learn enough about copywriting and marketing (which can take a week or two), there’s one main thing you should do every day… \n\n Outreach. \n\n That’s it. \n\n If you send pitches daily and make a concerted effort to improve your pitches, you will get a client. \n\n You don’t know when, but it will happen. \n\n You just have to work consistently. \n\n And if you’re smart enough to understand this email, you’re good. \n\n Now, you just have to be dumb enough to get out of your own way when you want to perfect every little detail instead of taking action. \n\n ​ You ready to get rich now? ​\n\n Godspeed, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. If you’re a complete newbie to online business, I have something exciting coming for you. \n\n If you hit ‘reply’ and say the word “info” there’s a good chance I’ll tell you about it tomorrow. \n\n Hint – Pierre Khoury and I have been working on… a powerpoint presentation ;) \n\n ​\n​",

But it’s impossible to intellectualize your way to a goal. Sometimes you just have to jump.” - Ben Bader \n\n Yes, I just quoted myself. \n\n Because there’s one thing I want to drill into your head on this beautiful Friday: \n\n YOU WILL NEVER BE READY. \n\n You’ll never be ready to start a business. \n\n You’ll never be ready to take up a new hobby. \n\n You’ll never be ready to get into a relationship. \n\n Please discard the idea that one day all of the stars will align and you’ll end up with the perfect opportunity to start something new. \n\n Progress doesn’t work like that. \n\n Almost all of my best opportunities have felt like accidents. \n\n When I first started making some money, I was doing freelance videography. \n\n That led me into the agency world. \n\n I then started a lead gen agency for basketball trainers. \n\n That led me into the info-product space. \n\n By then, I’d started posting on Twitter and built connections. \n\n Those connections ended up getting me clients. \n\n I didn’t plan any of this. It’d be impossible to do so. \n\n But throughout that time, I accumulated assets. \n\n I became a skilled marketer. \n\n My network grew. \n\n My personal brand became more prevalent. \n\n Action created the perfect storm. \n\n I didn’t wait for it. \n\n But before that, I wasted so much time trying to plan the perfect route. \n\n It’s a fool's game. \n\n If you resonate with what I’m saying and you find yourself looking for the perfect business model or waiting for some magical moment to start, I empathize with you. \n\n I wanted to know exactly how it’d all work out before I started. \n\n I’d sit at my desk mapping out the exact steps I’d take to hit $10k months. \n\n I’d bounce from one project to the next telling myself that I just needed the right vehicle. \n\n But eventually I realized that intellectualization is NOT a substitute for action. \n\n It’s a way to make yourself feel productive without being productive. \n\n And it won’t get you any closer to where you want to be. \n\n Just jump and trust that you’ll grow your wings on the way down. \n\n Are we clear? \n\n I hope so. \n\n ​ If you want to take that first step towards action, this can help you. ​ \n\n Have a good weekend, \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​ \n\n ​",

Writing \n\n 2. Making video content \n\n 3. “High pressure” interactions like a sales call or date \n\n Take a second and ask yourself when was the last time you did any of the three things above. \n\n And if it was recent, are you getting reps daily? \n\n If not, that needs to change. \n\n Consider that last interaction you had with someone who you’d deem a good communicator. \n\n How was their energy? \n\n Did they seem content in the life they’re living? \n\n Did you feel good around them? \n\n Odds are, that conversation was a breath of fresh air. \n\n And this is the reason I’m telling you all of this. \n\n To get anything you want in life, you need to demonstrate your value. \n\n If you can’t do that, it doesn't matter how smart or kind you are. \n\n It’s like being a basketball player who’s incredibly skilled but doesn’t perform well in real games. \n\n All of the work is eradicated by the fact that it isn’t presented when it matters. \n\n Don’t let that be you… \n\n ​ He who communicates most effectively, wins. ​\n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "Hello from a coffee shop in LA. \n\n I’m sitting outside with a large iced vanilla latte that has a bit too much milk in it. \n\n Let’s talk about risk. \n\n Recently, one of my newest students in Artisan Lab got a client within 48 hours of joining. \n\n He closed someone on a VSL script and funnel. \n\n As of right now, he has no idea how to do this. \n\n But he figured he’d close the deal anyway and use the resources inside my mastermind to learn what he needs on the fly. \n\n How irresponsible and misleading, right? \n\n Let’s weigh the potential outcomes here: \n\n Best case scenario, he builds a solid VSL funnel (which should be easy because he has me as a resource) and the client is happy. \n\n They continue working together and it makes him 5-6 figures over the next year. \n\n Worst case scenario, he builds the worst funnel in the world, the client hates it and fires him. \n\n And then… \n\n He goes back to the way his life was before. \n\n Now with a rep under his belt, knowing what he needs to improve. \n\n That's it. \n\n Meaning the worst case scenario is still a win. \n\n This is how most “risks” actually work. \n\n They’re win-win situations, and the only way you lose is by not taking them. \n\n When you think critically about it, this is the rational way to operate. \n\n A few years ago when I dropped out of college, here’s how I saw it: \n\n I could stay in school, get my degree and hope I find a job that makes me over $40k per year when I graduate. \n\n I’d be absolutely miserable but at least no one would look at me like I was crazy. \n\n That would be the “safe” route. \n\n Or I could drop out of college and take the “risky” route. \n\n I’d try to make this online business thing work and if it does, my life would be changed forever. \n\n Over the next few years I’d end up making multi-7 figures, move to Miami with my best friends, inspire thousands of people online, buy a porsche 911 turbo, and book a private jet across the country because it was raining. \n\n Obviously that’s how it ended up ;) \n\n But even when I looked at the potential downside, it’s not bad. \n\n Let’s say I didn’t get online business to work. \n\n I accept the fact that I have the IQ of an ape and go move back in with my parents. \n\n Maybe I’d use the skills I learned while trying to start a business to get a decent job. \n\n Maybe I’d do doordash and spend my free time in the sun. \n\n Maybe I’d go back to school and get my degree. \n\n And now, at least I can close my eyes at night knowing I wasn’t supposed to build a business because I actually tried and it didn’t work out. \n\n Getting that clarity is a win. \n\n When you break it down like this, NOTHING is risky. \n\n It’s all an illusion! \n\n They don’t want you to be rich, famous and handsome. \n\n But you’re here and you’re still reading this. \n\n ​ And that means you’re meant for more. ​\n\n Love you, \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​",

Close a client, get good results and repeat \n\n But maybe you’re telling yourself you’re not ready. \n\n You need to learn more or find some outreach system that you’re currently unaware of. \n\n That’s your mind playing tricks on you. \n\n In reality, you’re scared to start because you don’t know what you don’t know. \n\n And committing to this process will require you to step into a new version of yourself. \n\n It’s the version of you who doesn’t hesitate and knows you can figure things out on the fly. \n\n With this, comes additional pressure. \n\n “What if I get a client and run into a problem?” \n\n “What if my outreach is horrible?” \n\n It’s easier to stay where you are (and who you are) now while fooling yourself into thinking that you’re not ready. \n\n There’s a harsh truth of the universe that you need to understand: \n\n You will never be entirely prepared for anything. \n\n The stars will never align perfectly until you take the imperfect action. \n\n You can wait forever. \n\n And you’ll sit there, watching others who are no different from you get the results that you could’ve gotten, if you had the balls to start. \n\n This is something I’ve learned while coaching the members inside of Artisan Lab. ​ \n\n The biggest value I’m able to provide people with is conviction. \n\n Because they’ve paid me for coaching, they value the messenger more than the message. \n\n Meaning if I just confirm to someone that the logical action is right (even if they already knew that) my conviction and assurance is enough to get them to actually do it. \n\n The secret is understanding that there is no secret, and you’re as prepared now as you’ll ever need to be. \n\n It’s a cliche, but an accurate one. \n\n Progress is simple. \n\n Just actually do the thing that you know you need to do. \n\n Anyway, I dropped this video yesterday that people seem to really enjoy. ​ \n\n See you over there, \n\n Ben \n\n P.S. Here’s your last chance to get into Artisan Lab before the price goes up ​ \n\n ​\n​",

    "body": "There are three ‘micro-sales’ that need to occur if you want someone to buy coaching. \n\n In this email, I’ll reveal them while simultaneously utilizing them to sell you. \n\n Should be fun, let’s dive in: \n\n 1. The mechanism sale \n\n This is where you sell someone on the vehicle. \n\n The goal is to show them why your method to get the desired outcome is effective. \n\n Example – you want to make money online. \n\n There are countless business models you could choose from. \n\n All of them can work, but that doesn’t mean they’re all created equally. \n\n Many require capital, years of experience, or rely on finding gimmicks or hacks in the market and don’t teach you valuable skills. \n\n That’s why the Info-Product Agency is a solid option. \n\n It’s not a “business model,” it’s a skillset that makes you a valuable asset to any business. \n\n And because the online education industry is rapidly growing, it makes logical sense to work with people who sell info. \n\n There’s an abundance of potential clients you can work with and your ‘competition’ is horrible. \n\n Believe me, the pitches I get in my inbox are barely legible. \n\n So this means all you have to do is learn how to apply the skill of marketing to info-product businesses. \n\n And then go find them – which is easy because they want to be found (that’s how their business works). \n\n Oh, and it’s basically free to start. \n\n See what I did there? \n\n I made a logical argument as to why my mechanism works. \n\n That’s micro-sale #1. \n\n 2. The authority sale \n\n If you’re gonna buy from someone, you have to trust them (obviously). \n\n To do this, you need to: \n\n A. Show that you know what you’re talking about \n\n B. Show that you have no special advantages or ability that the audience doesn’t \n\n Let’s see this in action. \n\n Your typical guru hits a $20k month one time, then they turn around and start selling courses. \n\n 90% of their income is from their info-product, not the business they claim to be an expert in. \n\n I hit consistent $100k months for nearly a year before I ever sold my own info. \n\n This business has given me my dream lifestyle. \n\n And I know it can do the same for you, because I was once in your shoes. \n\n I bounced from one thing to the next, and felt like making money online was impossible for me. \n\n I’d make some money here and there, but nothing was sustainable or scalable. \n\n That was until I found the Info-Product Agency. \n\n After years of trying to make money online, I hit my first $15k month just four months after pivoting to the info-product space. \n\n And it’s why I’m so confident that this can work for you. \n\n Boom, there goes micro-sale #2, now you trust me. \n\n 3. The personal sale \n\n At the end of the day, people's biggest hesitations come from their own mind. \n\n They don’t believe in themselves. \n\n And it's your job as a marketer to change that narrative and give them hope. \n\n This is where you use social proof to show them that there are people who are just like them getting results. \n\n Here’s what that looks like: \n\n ​ My student Briar joined Artisan lab 3 months ago, making just $3k/mo from his 9-5 (none on his own). \n\n With my help, he just hit his first $10k month with his info agency. \n\n ​ Just two months after joining, Kabrin hit $20k/month after starting from scratch. \n\n ​ And lastly, Kidous (who runs a software company and is just doing this for fun) closed his first info client for $6k/mo + 10% rev share. client. \n\n Everyone you see here is no different from you. \n\n They've simply implemented the systems I've given them and they're reaping the benefits. \n\n ​ Go here now to join them. ​\n\n Aaaand that concludes micro-sale #3. \n\n See how this works now? \n\n Good. \n\n ​ Now hop in Artisan Lab and you'll become and money making machine. ​\n\n Later, \n\n Ben \n\n ​",

They want to connect with you. They want to help you. \n\n Nearly every business is built off of relationships. \n\n And awareness is the foundation of the way you interact with the world. \n\n Without it, you’ll struggle. \n\n Nearly anyone I’ve ever cut out of my life it’s been because of this reason. \n\n There’s just something that they’re missing from a social calibration standpoint. \n\n I don’t trust people like that, and neither does anyone else. \n\n If you’re still here reading this and you’re thinking “how do I become more aware?” That's up to you. \n\n There’s no tutorial here — \n\n But if you’re a conscious observer of your inner dialogue, you pay attention to the micro-expressions of others, and you have the confidence to act accordingly without exchanging your authenticity… \n\n ​ You’ll be further ahead than most. ​\n\n Bye, \n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​",

    "body": "Trump winning the election has me thinking about how I need a second term with you. \n\n Copy that line and send it to your ex. \n\n You’re welcome. \n\n Anyway, I’m sitting out on my balcony on a cloudy day here in Miami. \n\n I’ve been in a bit of a rut. \n\n As you may have noticed, I haven’t been very consistent with these emails recently. \n\n Every time I think about writing, it’s like my brain shuts off. \n\n Typically I can come up with an idea, open my laptop and 20 minutes later I’ll have a legible email. \n\n But as of late, that’s been a struggle. \n\n The advice I’d give to someone in my position when you just can’t get yourself to do something that you know you need to do is simple: \n\n Make it easy. \n\n If something feels like a herculean task, you won’t do it. \n\n But what if you take the pressure off? \n\n Instead of trying to write the perfect email, make the best content, or craft an amazing outreach message, you just do what you can. \n\n It might not be your best work ever, but it builds momentum. \n\n When you’re in a rut, that’s what you need. \n\n And the next time you sit down to complete whatever task you’re avoiding, it gets a bit easier. \n\n So that’s what this email is about. \n\n I have a friend who recently started making content on Tik Tok. \n\n He’s only made a few videos and keeps asking me for critiques. \n\n I told him to stop asking for help until he posts consistently for a month. \n\n Because right now, the quality doesn’t matter. \n\n He needs reps and data, and over time he’ll naturally work out the kinks. \n\n So {{ subscriber.first_name }}, for any new habit you’re trying to build, I’ll offer you the same advice. \n\n Start small, enjoy the process, and don’t chase perfection. \n\n If you show up for yourself consistently, it will work out. \n\n The tasks that once felt difficult will get easier. \n\n You’ll get into a rhythm and start swimming with the tide. \n\n ​ Just start building. ​\n\n Ben \n\n ​\n​",

That’s way more than I would’ve made in my first year out of college,” I thought to myself. \n\n That feeling of hopefulness remained as a buzz in the back of my mind for a while. \n\n It’s like I was the chubby, socially off kid on the basketball team who finally gets to play during senior night. \n\n I was just happy to be here. \n\n But at some point, that wore off. \n\n Unfortunately, it all worked and I got most of the things I wanted… Maybe a little too easily. \n\n Perhaps my vision for what I’d want after accomplishing my current status didn’t evolve fast enough. \n\n I guess that’s an easy thing to overlook when you begin to embark on any journey – What do I do if it works? \n\n In the past, my goals would naturally evolve. \n\n There was a point where I just wanted to make $5k per month. \n\n Once I got there, I wanted $10k per month and so on, all the way up to six figures a month. \n\n It was easy to keep going. That was until money stopped impacting my lifestyle. \n\n I already don’t have to think about expenses, I go on trips when I want, and I have my dream car. \n\n I could triple my income and it would have a minimal impact on my day to day life. \n\n But that’s where the goals have to evolve. \n\n More money now means more security. \n\n It means I can invest more and set up my future self and my perfect 10 wife, so we can have beautiful babies that go to the league. \n\n It means I can take care of and employ more people. \n\n That was never in the vision. \n\n I just wanted the flashy shit and fun lifestyle. \n\n But that part was surprisingly easy. \n\n This might read like I’m spoiled and ungrateful, but I’m sharing this because you will likely reach a point in your journey where you complete your vision. \n\n You’ll get everything that you believed was possible for you and find yourself in a position where life feels a bit dull, even though it might look exciting externally. \n\n That’s when you have to move the goal post back again. \n\n Find a new north star and begin working towards it. \n\n See you at the top, \n\n Ben \n\n PS - Go here to get 1 on 1 help from me and scale your info-product agency ​ \n\n PPS - Lmk if you made it all the way down here and liked this one :)\n​ \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

    "body": "Here are 10 things you need to understand if you want to build a successful info-product agency.\n\n Whether you're just starting out, or you already have some clients, these lessons will help you scale rapidly.\n\n Let's go:\n\n The singular “best” outreach system doesn’t exist. Anything can work, if you take the time to be creative and stand out in your pitches. Take initiative in solving issues that are in the best interest of the business, even if you are not directly responsible for them. Think for yourself before asking questions. In most cases the answer is obvious and you just need to take the obvious action. Your conscious brain is typically not your friend. When you find yourself thinking that you need more information before you can act, you are fooling yourself. If you don’t feel like you’re in over your head, you’re not saying “yes” enough. The best way to learn is on the fly. Do not obsess over systems and processes. Make money first, worry about efficiency later. Non-scalable actions differentiate you from your “competition.” Everyone can send dozens of mediocre pitches daily. Not everyone will take the time to correctly assess a situation and personalize a pitch to solve a specific problem. Not every client is going to be a homerun. There are two sides to the equation and if your client isn’t holding up their end of the bargain, there’s only so much you can do. Find a way to get your foot in the door. It can make sense to offer one service, perform well, and take over other parts of their business once you earn their trust and have a better understanding of the gaps in their business. The best opportunities are found when a client is making good money, despite the fact that their systems are being overlooked. Fixing those problems is like pouring gas on the flame. There we have it.\n\n Remember these 10 things and you'll be driving an SVJ in no time.\n\n ​ And if you want my personal help in growing your info-product agency or coaching business, click here. ​\n\n See you at the top,\n\n Ben\n\n ​",

    "body": "“I don’t know where to start.”\n\n Sound familiar?\n\n I was combing through Artisan Lab applications this morning and found a theme.\n\n There’s a question that asks applicants to share any roadblocks they’re facing.\n\n Around 90% of the answers are long-winded variations of “I don’t know where to start.”\n\n Whether it’s picking a business model, starting outreach, or creating content…\n\n Everyone finds a scapegoat as to why they aren’t taking action.\n\n Perhaps a better way of putting this dilemma is “I want to be told where to start.”\n\n You feel stuck because you have an abundance of options and you're not doing anything about it.\n\n Any business model can work.\n\n Any style of content can garner attention.\n\n Any outreach method can get you a client.\n\n But instead of trying something and seeing if it works, you convince yourself that you need more information.\n\n You’re left in a perpetual cycle of looking for more information rather than actively creating data that steers you in the right direction.\n\n One thing I know for sure is that everything that’s ever been created was done so from scratch.\n\n Someone, like you, didn’t know where to start.\n\n They tried something and it probably didn’t work the first time.\n\n So they tried a different method, now with more data.\n\n They do this over and over until they’ve crossed off many of the “wrong” answers.\n\n In doing so, they came closer to the answer…\n\n And then it clicks.\n\n Action creates clarity.\n\n The route to success is found after knifing through tens, hundreds, or even thousands of routes that don’t directly lead you to where you want to go.\n\n But they continuously reroute you until you arrive at your destination.\n\n And the once “directionless” version of you ceases to exist.\n\n I can’t tell you with full certainty what will work for you. Neither can anyone else.\n\n We’re all different people with various natural advantages and inclinations.\n\n That’s life.\n\n The ones who are rewarded are those who act despite the fact that there is no universal rulebook.\n\n You just gotta start moving and trust that you’ll find the answers while you’re running the race.\n\n There’s no way around this truth.\n\n ​ Trust yourself, and you’ll be rewarded. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​",

What you want?” \n\n Solid offer, but I refrained from ever taking them up on it. \n\n As I walked through the chaos, I could feel someone staring at me. \n\n I looked over and saw this guy who appeared to be around my same age. \n\n He came running up to me and asked, “is your name Ben??” \n\n I answered “yes” and he told me knew me from Twitter. \n\n We chatted for a bit and got a picture together. \n\n That was a surreal feeling. \n\n You mean to tell me that by simply making content through the little device I’m typing this on right now, people from all over the world could see it? \n\n And it could have enough of an impact on their life that they feel impelled to come up to me and say something? \n\n In Mexico of all places? \n\n That’s pretty cool. \n\n Now, as I sit here writing this from a Starbucks in Brickell, two people have come up to me saying they’ve seen my content. \n\n This typically happens multiple times a day now. \n\n But like anything, over time that surrealistic feeling from the beginning starts to wear off. \n\n It feels normal. I find myself taking it for granted. \n\n This isn’t an attempt to brag, sound like an asshole and tell you how famous I am. Although it may read that way. \n\n Rather it’s a reminder to myself and to you reading this — don’t take special for granted. \n\n It’s a privilege to wake up in the morning. \n\n It’s a privilege to work on something you care about. \n\n It’s a privilege to make your own schedule, travel, and take care of those around you. \n\n And it’s a privilege to be born in an era where you can use the device you’re reading this on as an all-powerful tool. \n\n You can make money. You can meet your best friends. You can create content that inspires, entertains, and helps others. Whether it’s one person, or thousands. \n\n That’s really fucking cool. And we’re lucky to be a part of it. \n\n No matter how big you get, how much money you have, or how many people want your time and attention… \n\n You’re never too important to appreciate the little things. \n\n ​ Don’t take special for granted, ​\n\n Ben \n\n ​ \n\n ​",

Young men are 4x more likely to commit suicide compared to women and 3x more likely to overdose on drugs. 20% of men (24-35) still live with their parents compared to just 12% of women. 1 out of every 3 men (18-24) hasn’t had sex in the last year. Marriage rates have gone down from 70% in 1970 to just 30% today. The average man doesn’t buy their first home until age 38, up from age 29 in 1981. The median income of young men has dropped from $73k in 1975 to just $40k today (adjusted for inflation). I’m not much of a numbers guy but this is completely insane.\n\n Young guys are poorer and more isolated than ever.\n\n The days where you could follow the beaten path and live comfortably are gone.\n\n If you don’t have high value skills that you can use to either build your own business of get a high paying job, you’re fucked.\n\n Unless you have an ivy league degree, you’re gonna be a doctor, or you have a clear path to making 6 figures in a 9-5, you’re left with two options…\n\n Be poor, unattractive to women, and live a miserable exist where you’re more likely to kill yourself or overdose on drugs than you are to become a millionaire. Bet on yourself. Start learning skills. Start a business and fail. Fail again and again. Want to quit. Push through the turmoil. Find success. Become a millionaire. Buy your dream car(s). Build an amazing circle of friends. Be desirable to women. And live the life you’ve always wanted to live. Which of the two options sounds better to you?\n\n The answer is obvious.\n\n But you gotta get through the hard part in the beginning where you want to flinch.\n\n And when you consider the alternative, that should make it a bit easier.\n\n I believe in you.\n\n ​ Go here to adopt the mindset that saved me from a life of mediocrity. ​\n\n Let me know if you liked this one,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

Not for a greater purpose. But for me.\n\n I wanted to escape the inevitable future pain of mediocrity.\n\n Is that selfish? Sure.\n\n But had I deluded myself into believing that I needed a stronger “why,” perhaps I never would’ve started.\n\n I could’ve rationalized, “I’m not motivated and I can’t work because my life is decent as it is.”\n\n Don’t let Simon Sinek (author of It Starts With Why ) fool you.\n\n Your “why” can be ripping an SVJ through the Hollywood hills.\n\n Your “why” can be having the autonomy to wake up at noon every day.\n\n Your “why” can be club-hopping in Ibiza with a bunch of ungrateful models.\n\n My point is stop worrying about your fucking “why” and make money.\n\n Do you want to be miserable?\n\n Do you want to be poor?\n\n Do you want to be an incel?\n\n No?\n\n Okay! Then what the fuck else are you gonna do with your time? Lol.\n\n Eventually, your motivating factors will naturally evolve.\n\n Once you check off the superficial desires, perhaps your focus will shift to retiring your parents, setting up future generations, or saving the Goddamn turtles.\n\n But right now, you probably don’t care much about any of that.\n\n If you’re honest with yourself, you just don’t want to worry about spending money.\n\n And that’s completely fine.\n\n You don’t need to find some moral justification to stay motivated.\n\n It’s okay to want something, simply because you want to prove to yourself that you can get it.\n\n ​ Ready to get rich now? ​\n\n See you at the top,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

Are you 12?\n\n Couldn’t be me.\n\n Although, my formerly white laces are now black from stepping on them into the pavement.\n\n Anyway, isn't it crazy that 2024 is almost over?\n\n The end of the year is always a good time to reflect.\n\n Odds are, you set some goals about 12 months ago.\n\n Let’s check in on them.\n\n Where are you settling?\n\n What are the things you told yourself that you’d do that you’re not doing?\n\n What areas of your life require more focus and attention?\n\n Personally, 2024 was a solid year but I feel like I didn’t squeeze as much juice out of it as I could have.\n\n I’m ready to step into a new reality.\n\n I feel like I have a real opportunity to grow my personal brand and I’ve been settling a bit too much.\n\n If you’re in a similar spot when it comes to your business or any other area of life, here’s my advice to you:\n\n You must be the agent of change in your own life.\n\n Nothing happens unless you make it happen.\n\n If you don’t create order, it will be created for you.\n\n With new habits comes an increased level of pressure and responsibility.\n\n This will make you want to flinch.\n\n That voice in your head will attempt to pull you back down to where you were previously.\n\n The actualization of your goals and the new version of yourself that you’re aiming to become relies on your ability to shut out that voice.\n\n So make it easier on yourself.\n\n Implement small habits that allow you to stay on track with your goals.\n\n That could be jotting down some action items each night before bed or making a list of prospects you’re going to reach out to.\n\n It’s small changes like this that create a ripple effect over time.\n\n Momentum will start to carry you once you get the ball rolling.\n\n But you have to commit.\n\n Set a new standard for yourself and abide by it.\n\n Come this time next year, you’ll be a completely different person. Likely with a much bigger number in your bank account.\n\n And you’ll be incredibly grateful that you didn’t let your previous self stop you.\n\n You’re just a few small changes away from a completely different life.\n\n Get after it,\n\n Ben\n\n PS Use this to kickstart your journey and make 2025 the best year of your life. ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

    "body": "I’m 40,000 feet in the air, writing this from seat 4A.\n\n Heading home to Cincinnati over the Holidays.\n\n It’ll be my first time back since last Christmas.\n\n This year has absolutely flown by, hasn’t it?\n\n I’m using this last week and a half of the year to prepare for 2025 and go into the new year with momentum.\n\n This is something I didn’t do a great job of going into 2024.\n\n I had a rough idea of what I wanted to accomplish and some goals written down, but I wasn’t very precise on the key levers that would make success inevitable.\n\n Because of this, it felt like I was playing catch up for the first few months of the year.\n\n This reminds me of something one of my high school basketball coaches used to always say…\n\n “If you’re not 15 minutes early, you’re late.”\n\n It takes time to stretch out, tie your shoes, and get some shots up before practice.\n\n If you show up “on time” you’ll miss your chance to get ready and be underprepared.\n\n This is how I’m thinking of this period until January 1st.\n\n It’s the 15 minutes before “game-time” that will dictate whether or not I go into the new year ready to make it the best one yet.\n\n I’m ready to make more money than ever, explode on social media, build a bigger team, and simply turn up the dial in all facets of my life.\n\n So if you want to go into 2025 like a rocket shot out of a cannon while others kick their feet up till the new year…\n\n Here are some things you should get clear on:\n\n What's the one thing that would make 2025 a success? \n\n This can be an income goal, fitness goal, social media growth, etc.\n\n Set your standards high and arrow it down to one thing that will make you feel accomplished.\n\n Be as specific as possible.\n\n How will you measure your progress towards that goal? \n\n If you don’t track it, you don’t improve it.\n\n Create a system where you can continually measure your progress and make sure you’re staying on par.\n\n This can be as simple as using a google doc or notion sheet.\n\n Again, be specific and write down exactly how you’ll keep track of growth.\n\n What processes can you put in place that will make the achievement of your goal inevitable? \n\n These are the big levers.\n\n If you set an income goal, this could look like “send 10 quality outbound pitches per day.”\n\n You can write down a few things here that have a direct impact on the achievement of your main goal.\n\n There we have it…\n\n I highly encourage you to not overlook these three questions.\n\n I know it might look corny or basic – I tend to have an aversion to doing things like this too.\n\n But this simple exercise can be the difference between a reality-changing 2025, versus yet another year where you feel like you didn’t make the strides you could’ve.\n\n Be different. Put both feet on the gas. And lap all the dorks sipping eggnog in pajamas for the next 10 days.\n\n And if you REALLY want to get ahead – go here now (only if you’re a psycho who’s ready to run through a fucking wall in order to make this your best year ever).\n\n Cheers,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. If you noticed a new font in this email, congrats on being observant. I was re-reading some of my old emails and found the last font a bit hard to read. Do you like this one better?\n​\n\n ​",

I am able to go where I want, buy what I want, and meet who I want. Reality bends itself to my desires. I am in the driver’s seat, steering the ship on how my life goes. I am in full control.

I am able to help my brothers. I am the person I have always wanted to be.”\n\n None of this was true at the time.\n\n But 2 months later I closed my first 3 paying clients at $1k per month each.\n\n By August, I hit $10k months and dropped out of college.\n\n I moved to Mexico and reached $15k months.\n\n Now as I sit here writing to you 4 years later, my life looks even better than the way I used to dream of it.\n\n I’ve built a 7 figure agency, grown my personal brand, and started helping others replicate my success. ​\n\n I’m telling you all to show you that I’m not special.\n\n I was once lost, undisciplined, and unfocused.\n\n But a series of decisions led me here.\n\n I began taking life seriously and I understood that nothing would change unless I made it change.\n\n New year's resolutions are corny and perhaps this is just some arbitrary date on the calendar…\n\n But your words are powerful.\n\n Today, you can decide that you’ll no longer accept mediocrity for yourself.\n\n You can begin keeping the promises you’ve made internally.\n\n You can take full control of your life and commit to your goals.\n\n And I promise you…\n\n In a few months you’ll start to see your dreams come to fruition.\n\n In a year you won’t recognize the old you.\n\n In a few years, your life will be better than you ever imagined.\n\n And you’ll be glad you started today.\n\n The world is yours… if you’re ready for it. ​\n\n Happy New Year,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

This person lacks the basic competence necessary to provide for themself and their family.*\n\n “OMG Ben, that's so insensitive”– shut up.\n\n Let’s talk about how to get fucking rich… Specifically working with people who sell info.\n\n I’m gonna break this down into phases for you (if you already have a client or two you can skip to phase 3):\n\n Phase 1: Exit the clueless monkey \n\n You’re lost.\n\n You hear about all these people making money online and the different ways of doing so.\n\n You don’t know what’s legit and what isn’t.\n\n You feel like a monkey who was taken out of the wild and placed at a dinner party.\n\n Here’s how to change this – Immerse yourself into the online business space.\n\n Tailor your social media feed to show you less baddies and more money.\n\n Build a swipe file of funnels, email copy, VSLs, etc.\n\n Phase 2: Enter the arena \n\n Once you understand the basics, you need to start getting real practice.\n\n Write samples. Ask Chat GPT or Claude AI to grade them.\n\n Keep improving and start doing outreach.\n\n Don’t listen to the voice that tells you that you’re not ready.\n\n Send as many high quality outreach messages as you can daily (I will teach you how to do this). ​\n\n Don’t stop until you get a client.\n\n Phase 3: Squeeze the lemon \n\n Congrats. You got a client or two.\n\n What you do now, can change your life.\n\n Imagine a billionaire hires you as a personal assistant.\n\n He tasks you with getting his coffee in the morning and that’s it.\n\n So, you spend the rest of your day finding ways to make his life easier.\n\n He sees your hard work and makes you his next of kin.\n\n This is *basically* what can happen if you maximize the opportunity with one solid client.\n\n Go above and beyond to improve any area of their business, even if you’re not directly responsible for it.\n\n This can snowball into a 5 figure rev share from that client. Plus a case study you can use to get more clients.\n\n There’s your 0-$100k/month blueprint.\n\n I know it sounds simple.\n\n The only part that’s more complicated is the identification of bottlenecks.\n\n Once you get a client, you have to be able to correctly assess the levers which need to be pulled to scale them.\n\n And before that, you have to determine if they’re even in a position that will allow them to scale.\n\n In Artisan Lab, you’ll learn how to do all of this.\n\n You’ll know who to reach out to, what a high quality pitch looks like, what to offer, how to close the deal, and how to make your clients a boatload of money.\n\n ​ Go here now and apply to join the winning team :) ​\n\n Talk soon,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

It’s definitely flat.\n\n I’m on my balcony watching the boats go by.\n\n The water is this beautiful blueish-greenish color and the sun is beaming, so it looks even more vibrant than usual.\n\n Switching gears to a much more somber note – I truly think some people are just NGMI (not gonna make it).\n\n It’s not that they can’t “make it” but rather that they won’t allow themselves.\n\n They’re too comfortable in their current self-image.\n\n Things aren’t bad enough because their perception of risk to reward is flawed.\n\n Going after what they want seems like this big leap of faith where if they fail their life is over.\n\n Obviously that’s almost never the case. If you put your all into anything, you will naturally unlock an abundance of additional opportunities.\n\n But they don’t understand this.\n\n So even though they may be unhappy, the desire to change doesn’t outweigh the perceived pain of it.\n\n From the outside looking in it’s easy to see that the “pain” really isn’t that bad.\n\n Sure, upgrading any area of your life comes with challenges – whether it’s financial pursuit or a different quest.\n\n And sure, there may be some level of risk involved but when you truly weigh your options, you see reality clearly.\n\n You can stay the same forever, merely flirting with the idea of success.\n\n Or you can think, “Why not? I’ll put my all into this endeavor and worst case scenario I end up back where I was beforehand.”\n\n Does that sound incredibly risky?\n\n To me, it doesn’t.\n\n And that’s why I think I was able to muster up the courage to attack my dream life despite the fact that I never had it that bad.\n\n As Socrates once said, “fuck it, we ball.”\n\n So as I sit here, writing this from my castle in the sky, I’m grateful that I’ve been able to view risk through this lens.\n\n It will work out for you too.\n\n But you actually have to allow yourself to try.\n\n I’ll leave you with a tweet I wrote over two years ago – “You're hesitant to hit the gas because you know it raises the bar. The further you get from the bottom the harder it’ll be to go back. You know what you're capable of but you're afraid to hold yourself to that standard. Then it's no longer an option to show up every day.”\n\n Go after everything you desire.\n\n ​ It will be worth it, ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

When I’d try to get it to spice things up it’d sound too try-hardy.\n\n Nonetheless, it was somewhat useful.\n\n That was until I got better at prompting and training it.\n\n This took it from a 4/10 to an 8/10.\n\n And I STILL think I’m just scratching the surface.\n\n When you input enough data with the right prompt(s) it’s capable of writing a sufficient email that’s indistinguishable from human copy.\n\n I’d be willing to bet it’s better than 99% of beginner to intermediate level writers.\n\n Here’s what this means for you:\n\n It’s a tool that you NEED to utilize.\n\n Go down the rabbit hole and become familiar with popular AI softwares (not just Chat GPT).\n\n Once you do so, it will make you better, more efficient, and nearly do your job for you.\n\n It’s not something to fear, IF you learn it.\n\n If you don’t… well Nǐ hǎo, my friend.\n\n Extra large fries please.\n\n If you want to see how I’m using it inside of my business…\n\n ​ I’ll be sharing everything I learn about AI in the coming months here. ​\n\n Don’t get left behind,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

My lifestyle was incredibly fun.\n\n And complacency reared its ugly head again.\n\n For a while, it won.\n\n Until one day I woke up and thought to myself…\n\n “Brother, you’re putting in a fraction of the effort you could be, and things are still working. What would happen if you go all in?”\n\n Perhaps this sounds familiar.\n\n Whether you’re just starting out, or you’ve gotten comfortable at your current level of income.\n\n I’ll offer you some advice a mentor of mine gave me recently…\n\n If life’s already good at this level, imagine how much better it is at levels above this. \n\n We’re playing a never ending game here.\n\n The higher you go, the better life gets.\n\n Not because you can buy another supercar, move to a better place, and take care of those around you (although that’s a nice plus).\n\n But because you’re actualizing the potential you know you have inside of you.\n\n With each level you progress, you unlock an upgraded version of yourself.\n\n And after all, what else is there to do?\n\n ​ Resist the plague and life will keep getting better. ​\n\n To overcoming complacency,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n​",

Wrap around floor to ceiling windows. And more space than I know what to do with.\n\n During my search, I found this penthouse for $19k/mo.\n\n It’s 2,500 square feet, marble floors, huge living area, big balcony etc.\n\n Basically everything I want.\n\n To move there, I’d pay at least $10k to break my current ($5k/mo) lease.\n\n Then another $30k+ furnishing the new place.\n\n And then obviously my rent would quadruple.\n\n It’s not that I couldn’t do it, but it would sting.\n\n And that pissed me off.\n\n There’s something I want.\n\n And I can’t get it.\n\n Because it’s too… expensive ?\n\n My fingers hurt just typing the word expensi– I can’t do it again.\n\n Am I a child?\n\n Should I start asking permission to go to the bathroom too?\n\n This lit a fire under me.\n\n My lease is up in July and by then, I want to be in a position where I can spend $15k+ on rent without batting an eye.\n\n If I can’t, I’ve dishonored my entire bloodline.\n\n People often tell you to find a strong “why” – some altruistic motive that drives you.\n\n And while I’m motivated by actualizing my potential and being able to take care of the people around me, sometimes that’s not enough.\n\n My family isn’t in poverty.\n\n Mom’s already retired and my Dad has more money in cars than most do in savings.\n\n I don’t need to rescue anyone.\n\n So sometimes, I’ll lean on superficial things as a source of motivation.\n\n I’ll picture myself hopping out of a new supercar and walking into my penthouse.\n\n And guess what?\n\n In case no one’s ever told you this, allow me — it’s okay to want what you want.\n\n If you’re not motivated, maybe you’re just not being honest with yourself.\n\n You listened to dorks online tell you that you can’t want the flashy lifestyle.\n\n Now you’re mad at your parents for raising you in a good home because you don’t have a strong enough “why.”\n\n Be real with yourself. If you want to make money so you can hangout with baddies on the beach all day, then work really hard so you can do exactly that. ​\n\n Sure, at some point you’ll probably need a deeper reason to keep pushing.\n\n But that’s not a worry right now.\n\n ​ Get to the bag. You’ll find your purpose along the way.\n\n I’ll see you in the Penthouse,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

Basically asking for permission to think.\n\n You’ll be the person who asks Google-able questions.\n\n And worst of all, the excess of opinions will stun you.\n\n Different potential solutions to problems get jumbled around in your head.\n\n Any of which could work.\n\n But because you haven’t built up internal conviction by making your own decisions, you can’t decide and commit. ​\n\n And even the smallest amount of resistance can pull you back to inaction.\n\n So how do you fix this?\n\n How do you start trusting yourself and feeling like you're in the driver’s seat of your life?\n\n How do you begin to rely on your inner voice?\n\n Here’s the solution…\n\n Stop waiting for me (or anyone else) to give you an answer that you already have.\n\n Ask yourself “How do I start building internal conviction?”\n\n Ponder that question and come up with some simple ideas…\n\n It can be minor changes to your habits.\n\n Starting a hobby you’ve been putting off.\n\n Pursuing a new opportunity in your business.\n\n Whatever it is, it doesn't have to be anything wild or crazy.\n\n But you need to show yourself that you can take actions simply because you want to.\n\n You don’t need permission.\n\n You don’t need advice.\n\n You need you.\n\n And luckily, you’re all you’ll ever have. ​\n\n Conviction is the great equalizer.

Don’t go looking for answers that you already have.\n\n Talk tomorrow,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. Obviously there is nuance to this and there are times where guidance from people you trust is 100% helpful.

They learn the basics.\n\n 2. They dive in well before they feel ready.\n\n 3. They solve problems on the fly.\n\n 4. They adapt, carve their lane, and find success.\n\n There is no way around this.\n\n Most people get caught up in step 1 and 2 because they start overcomplicating it.\n\n Let’s say you’re building an info-product agency.\n\n You need to do two things…\n\n Learn the fundamentals of copywriting for coaching businesses.\n\n Do outreach.\n\n Everything else is a waste of time.\n\n You can spend weeks or months contemplating a niche, offer, what to say in your outreach, etc.\n\n All you’re doing is avoiding action.\n\n When you get a client, you’ll then have a better vantage point to understand what bottlenecks need to be solved.\n\n You just can’t let the unknown stop you from putting one foot in front of the other.\n\n Steve Jobs didn’t know how he’d build Apple.\n\n Zuckerberg didn't have Facebook mapped out.\n\n They just started and figured it out along the way.\n\n The same applies to you.\n\n You don't need to know how you'll get to $100k months.\n\n You just need to know your next step.\n\n For you, that's probably sending your first outreach message.\n\n Or jumping on your first sales call.\n\n Or closing your first client.\n\n Everything after that?\n\n You'll figure it out when you get there.\n\n ​ Ready to take your first step?

You think you can learn everything for free on Youtube\n\n 2. You don’t fully understand the info-product agency model\n\n 3. You’re worried you won’t be able to get clients\n\n 4. You’re unclear on what you’d do for clients and how you’d pitch them\n\n 5. You think it sounds too complex to start right now\n\n There are more potential objections, but those are the 5 most prevalent I hear.\n\n I’ll show you how I’d overcome a couple of them…\n\n Objection 1: \n\n The truth is, you can learn most of what you'd need to know on Youtube.\n\n But it’ll slow you down immensely.\n\n Instead of having a step-by-step roadmap showing you what to do every day for the next 90 days…\n\n You’ll have to spend hours digging through mud to find gems on social media.\n\n And even then, how will you know what information to trust?\n\n It’s a gamble.\n\n If you have time to waste, by all means figure it out on your own.\n\n But if you want a sure thing?\n\n Coaching is the way to go.\n\n Objection 2: \n\n So you’ve heard people talk about building an info-product agency but you’re unsure where to start.\n\n Let me break it down for you:\n\n Your job is to partner with a content creator who posts educational content.\n\n They focus on getting more attention, you focus on selling their coaching program.\n\n To do this, you’ll start by learning the foundational skill of copywriting.\n\n Next you’ll get up to speed on the info-product space – I’ll teach you about offers, funnels, VSLs, webinars, etc.\n\n After 2-4 weeks of active studying and practice reps, you’ll be ready to start outreach.\n\n Boom.\n\n See what I’m doing here?\n\n If I were writing a VSL or sales page I’d simply continue to address objections 3-5.\n\n Prospects would feel understood and trust me to lead them to the solution.\n\n So there’s your answer Mr. Parakeet.\n\n Want to see me overcome the rest of your objections?\n\n ​ Go here now and you’ll see a clear example of everything I just told you about. ​\n\n To better copy,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n​",

Laziness/unawareness\n\n ChatGPT and Claude have been around for a while now.\n\n Most info-product sellers already know this.\n\n But still, they haven’t taken the time to use them effectively on their own.\n\n They prefer bringing someone on to do the work for them rather than diving into the AI world themselves.\n\n 2. A vast skill set makes you irreplaceable\n\n An email copywriter who writes a few half decent emails a week is expendable.\n\n You could be replaced with AI or by any of the other horny copywriters in your clients DMs.\n\n But if you’re offering a multitude of services – funnels, VSLs, offer creation, sales management, automations, etc…\n\n You’re invaluable.\n\n AI can’t do all of that on its own (although it can help you do it more effectively).\n\n We’re entering a golden era. ​\n\n There’s a lot of money to be made over the next 4 years.\n\n And it’d be a shame if you don’t capitalize on it.\n\n ​ Go here and I’ll show you how you can use AI to your advantage. ​\n\n Have a good weekend,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

If you want to learn how to build an info-product agency the right way – with systems that work for both organic and paid traffic – I can show you here. ​\n\n You’ll learn how I’ve scaled offers all the way up to $700k/month, how I get the best clients in the business, and how you can do the same.\n\n ​ Go here to apply for a strategy call. ​\n\n ​\n​",

Learn copywriting \n\n I’m not saying this to sell you, I’m saying this because it’s the most versatile skill you can learn.\n\n You can pitch local businesses, eCom brands, agencies, or coaching businesses.\n\n To reach escape velocity, you only need $5-10k/month.\n\n That’s like two or three clients on retainer. Or one solid client on a rev share (tutorial). ​\n\n If you’re starting from zero, pitch anyone and everyone.\n\n Take $500 retainers.\n\n Do free work for a testimonial.\n\n Work with your Grandma’s friend's niece who owns a wildly unprofitable bakery (even though she sells $8 coffee).\n\n You just need experience and money.\n\n Do this for six months and you’ll be in a decent spot.\n\n Let’s say you’re making around $5-7k per month…\n\n Step 2. Move somewhere cheap \n\n Get your passport, buddy. I hope you like latinas.\n\n Head over to Tulum, Mexico or somewhere similar.\n\n Bonus points if you make sure you’re not gonna get captured by a local gang.\n\n Now it’s time to lock in.\n\n You’ll save most of your money and spend the time you’re not working on a beach.\n\n Stay here until you start making software engineer money. \n\n For me this phase was four months.\n\n By the end, I was making around $15k per month and had nearly $100k in savings.\n\n Step 3. Bienvenidos a Miami \n\n Time to up the stakes.\n\n You’ve proven to yourself that you can consistently make money on your own.\n\n It doesn’t appear the business will randomly collapse any time soon. And if it does you’ve got some cash in the bank.\n\n Open up your wallet and find a spot in a bigger city.\n\n You’ll likely spend more on rent than you were spending total the previous few months.\n\n That’s okay, you need pressure.\n\n Between the pressure, your now year of experience in the game, and the connections you’ll make in your new city…\n\n It’s inevitable you’ll get to $30k, $50k, and eventually $100k/month plus.\n\n And maybe I’ll run into you in line to get a cancer-curing latte :)\n\n If you made it down here and you’re ready to do this…\n\n ​ Here’s a good place to start. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​",

I share full breakdowns of this kind of stuff inside Artisan Lab. ​\n\n If you want to see this entire process in depth, including:\n\n - How to craft a winning offer that the audience will actually want\n\n - Selecting the perfect price point for the offer\n\n - The exact emails/ strategies I’ve used to build hype\n\n - How to write a launch VSL\n\n - The full webinar template we’ve used to make six figures in a single day\n\n And much more…\n\n ​ Go here to apply for coaching and steal everything I’ve learned in the past couple of years. ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

Got about $20K left. \n\n I should’ve gone to Asia instead of Canada. \n\n If you’re living on savings, DO NOT move to the West. The same money would’ve taken me 10x further. \n\n Made no money while I’ve been here. Just watching my bank balance shrink. \n\n My X account is dead because I barely tweet. Years of growth, gone. \n\n Meanwhile, some people are making millions per month by selling some stupid course on how to get rich. \n\n I hate how unfair life can be.” \n\n As I began reading the tweet I figured he’d turn it around at some point.\n\n You know like, hook you with a sob story and then tell you how he persevered.\n\n But there is no perseverance in sight.\n\n Just pity and blame.\n\n Normally I’m empathetic but this guy lost me when he started hating on course gurus and said how life is unfair.\n\n You can argue with reality, or you can learn the rules and win the game.\n\n Whatever you do, don’t start feeling sorry for yourself.\n\n Don’t blame your inadequacies on external factors.\n\n Don’t harbor resentment for those who find success.\n\n And perhaps most importantly, don’t quit before it’s even close to over.\n\n That guy said he had $20k left and based on his spending that’s another 6 months of expenses.\n\n Even if he blew through that, there’s always another option.\n\n You are as resilient as you allow yourself to be.\n\n Nothing worth having comes easy. \n\n You’ll be tested and tricked. But if you make it through, the other side is beautiful.\n\n And you’ll know that you earned it.\n\n You only lose when you throw in the towel.\n\n Don’t go crying to strangers on the internet,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S.

    "body": "“If what they taught actually worked, they wouldn’t be selling a course on it.” \n\n This is a common argument you’ve probably heard against course sellers.\n\n It’s a valid concern and true in some cases.\n\n Many reach an iota of success from their business and immediately start selling info on it.\n\n That annoys the hell out of me.\n\n A singular $10k month does not make you an expert.\n\n Personally, I made over $100k/mo with my agency before I ever sold coaching.\n\n Here’s a literal screenshot from my bank statement in September 2023 for proof:\n\n ​ That being said, different business models scale to varying levels.\n\n For example most closers cap out around $20-30k/mo.\n\n Let's say a closer reaches that number for a while.\n\n After a year or two in sales, they begin selling info on it and get to $100k/mo as a coach.\n\n I see no problem with it as long as they’re not claiming you can make 6 figures monthly from sales.\n\n It’s a good beginner business model to make your first $10-30k/mo.\n\n But it’s quite the anomaly to scale past that.\n\n This is the case for many of the other popular business models as well.\n\n However, the Info-Product Agency is different.\n\n Even if you’re just starting out, a few retainers and/or rev shares can get you past $10k/month.\n\n Once you do that, you’ll be much more skilled.\n\n And then you can start getting bigger clients and higher rev shares.\n\n That can take you to $50k or even $100k/month like it did for me.\n\n I made over $2m in about two years from my agency.\n\n I got a high rise in Miami from my agency money.\n\n I bought my dream car from my agency money.\n\n Most people who sell coaching can’t say that the business they teach made them rich.\n\n They made good money from it, but great money from info.\n\n I’m doing both.\n\n So my question for you is this…\n\n Would you rather pick a business model that inevitably caps out at a relatively low income threshold?\n\n Or would you rather pick a model that can scale to 7 figures annually?\n\n (Which is not easy whatsoever but it is possible, as I am living proof).\n\n That’s a choice you’ll have to make.\n\n But if you wanna learn from someone who got rich by doing, not teaching…\n\n ​ Go here now and get access to my blueprint. ​\n\n To ethical info,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

Open a new project in Claude.\n\n I’d upload my last 25+ emails as PDFs.\n\n Then prompt Claude to build a full breakdown of my style and tone.\n\n Perhaps I’d have it create a list of frequent topics I write about as well.\n\n This would likely be the most time consuming part, but once it’s done, we’re smooth sailing.\n\n Step 2. Transcribe my Youtube videos\n\n Let’s say I make a Youtube video about why eating seed oils gives you superpowers.\n\n I could take that transcript and upload it to Claude.\n\n Then I’d say, “Hey Mr. Claude. Please write a complete email to my list in my tone and style using a topic from the seed oil superpower video. P.S. You look really handsome today.”\n\n My glorious robot would then give me a complete email.\n\n And after a few tweaks, you’d be sitting here reading it with no idea it’s AI copy.\n\n The only downside here is transcribing the videos could take a bit.\n\n I share a way where you can drastically speed up that process here. ​\n\n Step 3. Get creative\n\n Once I have this AI version of me (which I could actually make even better by fine tuning it, but that’s a bit harder), the sky’s the limit.\n\n I could give it an idea and analogy to use and have it spit out an email.\n\n I could tell it to reference a book I’m reading or use a lesson from a certain movie.\n\n I could have it write a complete email based on one of my Tweets.\n\n As long as I’m creative with my prompts, the emails would never get redundant or feel like AI.\n\n Now I enjoy writing these so I’ll never do that.\n\n But if I wanted to, I could.\n\n Which is pretty cool.\n\n However I must add a big caveat here:\n\n If you’re not already a decent copywriter, this won’t work for you.\n\n I’ve written hundreds of emails. I easily come up with creative analogies and metaphors.\n\n The process is second nature at this point.\n\n Because of these reasons, AI can be useful.\n\n But without them, it’s like giving nuclear launch codes to a squirrel on meth.\n\n No bueno.\n\n Still typing my own damn emails,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. There’s a way to make the process I outlined here take minutes instead of hours. I’ve built a system that cuts the time down by 80%. Soon I’ll be able to share it publicly, but for now you can get exclusive access by going here. ​\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​",

If you want to learn the entire system that we’ve built for live webinars…\n\n Which is responsible for generating too many millions to count…\n\n ​ I’m giving away the entire system —but only for those who move fast.\n\n The funnel, the slides, the emails, the texts, the pitch, the upsells.\n\n Everything.\n\n ​\n​\n​\n​",

Finding the right clients (info-product businesses with existing traffic)\n\n 2. Structuring profitable rev share deals\n\n 3. Building a predictable system that scales\n\n And obviously – working really fucking hard.\n\n He went from making roughly $120k per year to over a MILLION DOLLARS per year in 7 months.\n\n Now – I can’t promise you the same type of results as Jace.\n\n Because frankly, his results are insane and he’s a maniac (in a good way lol).\n\n It’d be audacious to claim you’re gonna 10x your income in less than a year like he did.\n\n But if you put in the effort…\n\n And if you follow the same principles… ​\n\n It’d be reasonable to assume you can achieve a fraction of the success he’s had.\n\n Some students reach $10k months. Others hit $20-30k. And a handful, like Jace, go even further.\n\n The beauty is that even the \"modest\" results would completely transform most people's lives.\n\n If you want to learn the exact system Jace used, I've documented everything inside Artisan Lab. From outreach, to client onboarding, to scaling strategies, and much more.\n\n ​ Apply here to see if it's right for you. ​\n\n To realistic expectations and exceptional results,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

The person with a 520 credit score who’ll be paying off your course for the next 76 years isn’t a competent, responsible human being lol).\n\n They’re unrealistic, lazy, and don’t take accountability.\n\n This turns off serious prospects because no one wants to be surrounded by a bunch of room temperature IQ smooth brains.\n\n You’ve created a little idiot army. Congrats.\n\n Here’s how to avoid this:\n\n Do not overpromise.\n\n Do not take customers' last dollar.\n\n Do not claim they won’t have to work hard\n\n When you’re realistic in your marketing, people get results like this:\n\n ​ Dom got a new client 3 days in (this is rare but not impossible).\n\n ​ Marcus got a new client less than 4 weeks in (also rare, not impossible).\n\n ​ And Vander, struggled for a couple months (perhaps the most realistic timeline) but is now breaking through, signing two clients in the past week.\n\n I will not promise you get rich.\n\n I will simply give you the resources, information, and network that has made me (and many students) rich.\n\n What you do that this is up to you...\n\n Do not click here and apply for Artisan Lab if you’re stupid.\n\n Do not click here and apply for Artisan Lab if you think it’ll be easy.\n\n But if you’re a winner…\n\n There’s no better place to be.\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​",

Your speed of execution. I used to never understand what people meant when they discussed leverage.\n\n It sounded like a buzzword that guru #138 would throw around while wearing dorky blue light blockers.\n\n And then, I started to actually understand leverage (in this context).\n\n Leverage is when you can write one email or make one video and generate six figures.\n\n Leverage is when one hire frees up a month’s worth of time and energy.\n\n Leverage is when you can build something once and create systems that allow for exponential growth.\n\n The more connections, influence, and manpower you have, the more leverage you have, and the richer you get.\n\n Secondly, your speed of execution dictates everything.\n\n Life and entrepreneurship are just games of data.\n\n You have to experience things to know what you like, what you don’t like, what works, and what doesn’t.\n\n The quicker you implement ideas, the quicker you get more data.\n\n More data creates better decisions.\n\n Better decisions create more wealth.\n\n I don’t want to be the hardest worker in the room.\n\n I want to be the one with the most leverage and the quickest to execute.\n\n Then I’ll be doing donuts on a Jetski in the Atlantic ocean while the hardest worker is at a desk in a dark room trying to figure out something I did months ago.\n\n To working smarter,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. Inside Artisan Lab, you’ll learn how to create leverage and move faster - the exact way I built a 7-figure agency without working myself to death.\n\n If you’re ready to stop grinding endlessly and start building real leverage (with the help of AI), go here to apply. ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

That.\n\n This way of thinking is for the mentally enslaved.\n\n But you {{ subscriber.first_name }}, as a reader of the best newsletter on the internet, deserve better…\n\n You owe yourself better.\n\n When you’re quick to make compromises, here’s what happens:\n\n Your Ferrari dreams turn into a Corolla (or perhaps you buy a corvette C8 when you’re 68 and try to convince yourself it’s a real supercar).\n\n Your supermodel wife turns into a plus sized hand model. Or your “rich husband” turns into a guy that makes $105k/yr and loves to say he makes six figures.\n\n Your dream of waking up to the sound of the waves crashing on the shore only happens 3 days a year. And you’re on vacation in Myrtle Beach, not Honolulu.\n\n I know this sounds a bit dramatic, but making compromises when it comes to your desires is a slippery slope.\n\n You need to be militant.\n\n You need to be stubborn.\n\n You need to aim for what you actually want.\n\n When others tell you to be reasonable, or when you begin to hear a voice in your head negotiating with you, shut it out.\n\n I’d rather be an insane, unreasonable, stubborn asshole than a chubby balding middle aged man… in a COROLLA!\n\n Do not tolerate behavior that doesn’t align with your goals.\n\n When you make a plan, stick to it as if you are following orders from God.\n\n There is no negotiating, there is no settling, and when you find yourself exchanging “great” for “good enough,” stop yourself.\n\n If you compromise, I guess I’ll send you a postcard from Honolulu.\n\n That’s basically the real thing isn’t it! LOL!\n\n No. Stop. It’s not the real thing. And a C8 isn’t a supercar. And fuck Mrytle Beach.\n\n Their rules and standards are meant to be broken. Yours aren’t.\n\n See you in a Ferrari with a supermodel in your passenger seat.\n\n To the stubborn and unreasonable – I will help you win. ​\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. I’d feel slightly irresponsible by not clarifying some nuance here.\n\n Not compromising doesn’t mean you refuse to turn up the temperature when you set it at 67 and your girl wants it at 72.\n\n It also doesn’t mean that there is only one way to accomplish a goal and the route can’t be adjusted.\n\n But when it comes to the real shit you want…\n\n Don’t let anyone talk you out of it (including yourself).\n\n ​ This is for those who refuse to compromise. ​\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​",

The chances of you making TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS in a single week are slim to none. That is absolute insanity and you will likely not replicate Jace’s success.

Are you destined to put fries in a bag until AI comes and replaces you again?\n\n Maybe.\n\n Here’s what I think:\n\n The edge isn’t voice anymore.\n\n It’s perspective.\n\n AI can mimic cadence. It can’t manufacture conviction.\n\n It can remix a thought.

(Not like you had a choice anyway.)\n\n Prompt:\n\n Write and email about why most people fail when trying to start a business in the info/agency world. \n\n BenGPT:\n\n \"Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }}, \n\n Here’s the part they don’t tell you in those “how I made $100K/month” YouTube videos: \n\n Most people don’t fail because of strategy. \n\n They fail because they’re fucking soft. \n\n They read Russell Brunson, buy a cold email course, slap together an offer, and post 3 times on Twitter. \n\n Then wonder why clients aren’t lining up to wire them $5K. \n\n Meanwhile, the guy who is getting clients? \n\n He’s not smarter than you. Or more talented. Or even better looking (unless it’s me, in which case, sorry bro). \n\n He just didn’t stop. \n\n The truth is, most people enter the info/agency game with all the wrong expectations. \n\n They think: \n\n It’s gonna be passive. It’s gonna be fast. It’s gonna feel good. Wrong, wrong, and LOL. \n\n What it’s gonna feel like is: \n\n Rewriting your VSL script 7 times and still hating it. \n\n Getting ghosted by 33 different leads in a row. \n\n Having a panic attack after realizing you owe Stripe $1,200 in fees. \n\n This is not a business for people who crave comfort. \n\n This is a business for psychos. \n\n The type who’ll build a landing page at 2am just because he had a weird idea in the shower. \n\n If that’s not you – cool. \n\n Go get a job. Live a peaceful life. Watch Netflix and pay rent forever. \n\n But if it is you? \n\n Then you need to stop acting like a confused beginner and start behaving like someone who’s already successful. \n\n Because here’s the truth: \n\n There are only 3 things that actually matter when starting your agency/info-biz: \n\n A skill that solves a painful problem A system that gets that skill in front of people The brain damage tolerance to repeat that until rich That’s it. \n\n Everything else is masturbation. \n\n You don’t need another course. \n\n You don’t need a better logo. \n\n You don’t need to ask your group chat for feedback on your offer doc. \n\n You just need to move. \n\n Fast. Messy. Relentless. Like your future depends on it – because it does. \n\n Ben\" \n\n [End] \n\n Pretty solid, yeah?\n\n And that was with a half-baked, one-sentence prompt.\n\n Obviously there’s still some magic that comes from real-life experiences, fresh insights, and having a pulse.\n\n But voice-wise?\n\n I’d say it’s 90% of the way there.\n\n Here’s the coolest part:\n\n I now have a repeatable framework I can use with every client.\n\n Import their data. Feed it the right examples.\n\n And 30 minutes later? Boom -- I have a writing clone that sounds just like them.\n\n If you want to learn how to do the same — I’ll teach you inside Artisan Lab. ​\n\n I’ll be in the cabin.\n\n You bring the alpacas.\n\n See you in Alaska,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

Skill set \n\n This one’s the most obvious.\n\n Learn a skill that other people find valuable, trade that skill for money.\n\n This is the prerequisite.\n\n It’s the equivalent of a college degree in the entrepreneur world (except it actually means something).\n\n As you increase competency, you grow capable of solving bigger problems that pay better.\n\n Once this foundation is laid, the other two elements unlock…\n\n 2. Opportunity vehicle \n\n This is what you’re selling and who you’re selling to.\n\n The best marketer in the world will make no money if their clients are broke.\n\n On the contrary, apply your skill set the right way (in a growing industry where people are making lots of money) you’ll be paid in proportion.\n\n Nail these two, and money starts to rain.\n\n And then, there’s the third which makes everything click…\n\n 3. Influence \n\n This is who you know and who knows you.\n\n It could mean attention on social media or even just a network of the right people.\n\n That’s it.\n\n Skill, vehicle, influence.\n\n Master all three and business becomes unfairly easy.\n\n Ignore even one… and you’ll feel like you’re a stripper without rhythm. Or an ass.\n\n So here’s the move:\n\n Audit yourself.\n\n What’s missing?\n\n What’s the next smallest move to fix it?\n\n For me, working with course sellers was the unlock.\n\n Skillset? Check — copywriting and funnel building were finally being put to good use.\n\n Vehicle? Check — these creators had leverage, audience, and cash flow.\n\n Influence? Check — proximity to high-level operators opened more doors than I could count.\n\n It was the rare overlap of all 3 elements.\n\n And once I leaned in, everything changed.\n\n If you’re still trying to force something that doesn’t check all three boxes…\n\n ​ Maybe it’s time to pivot. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​",

The Carrera is a nice daily.\n\n From ten feet away you’d never know.\n\n But the second you hit the gas?\n\n The Turbo S launches.\n\n The Carrera just… moves.\n\n That’s the power of what’s under the hood.\n\n In the coaching space, your product is your engine .\n\n And most people forget about it.\n\n A good product means sexier marketing.\n\n Your testimonials are your rims, wheels, and headlights.\n\n You can coast with a shit product…\n\n Until you floor it next to someone with real horsepower.\n\n Then you blow up.\n\n Artisan Lab is finally to the point where it feels like a V10.\n\n When I started coaching, it was just a private group and a few calls.\n\n I let in 20 people and used it as a test run.\n\n Took the feedback.\n\n Built out a full course.\n\n Rebranded it from The Bader Group to Artisan Lab .\n\n That’s where most people stop.\n\n They build the course, toss in some weekly calls, and shift all attention to marketing.\n\n But here’s the truth:\n\n If your product isn’t improving, it’s deteriorating.\n\n So I kept going:\n\n I update the content constantly based on where people get stuck Every call is recorded and labeled inside a searchable vault I bring in 7–8 figure entrepreneurs twice a month for guest sessions I paid one of my star students to build an outreach course, and my sales guy to build a sales management course Sean — one of the best marketers I know — runs weekly calls and offers 1-1 support And as of yesterday, Jace (you’ve probably seen him in a testimonial) is now running an additional weekly group call Here’s the current engine:\n\n Content – funnels, copywriting, sales, acquisition, personal brand & everything in between\n\n 1-1 Support – from me and Sean\n\n Active 24/7 Community – no idiots allowed, only winners\n\n Coaching – 3 weekly calls, led by me, Sean, and Jace (plus bi-weekly guest calls)\n\n Plus plug and play SOPs, frameworks, and all the other more boring stuff...\n\n This has inadvertently turned into a pitch.\n\n But that’s kinda the point.\n\n When your product is actually good , you don’t need to force a transition or do some weird NLP sales voodoo.\n\n You just talk about it.\n\n Because you’re proud of the engine you’ve built.\n\n ​ Artisan Lab is the engine.\n\n Everything else is just the body kit.\n\n And if you want to go fast, you’re gonna need something under the hood that doesn’t explode when it gets on the highway.\n\n ​ Apply here if you want to build your own Turbo S. ​\n\n Not a Corolla with a spoiler (or God forbid a corvette C8).\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n​\n\n ​",

Not a good combo, typically.\n\n But I had a cheat code.\n\n Any time I got stuck, I’d turn to AI.\n\n “Hello, my Glorious KingGPT. How do I sum an itemized list based on certain criteria? Plz reply. Thx ily.”\n\n AI would then give me the exact formula to plug in.\n\n I’d follow its instructions.\n\n And if anything broke, I’d simply take a screenshot and ask it what went wrong.\n\n With AI’s help, the sheet took me around 30 minutes to build.\n\n Without it, it would’ve taken hours or I would’ve quit.\n\n It also saved me time after a sales call yesterday.\n\n My “AI Companion” joined my Zoom meeting with me.\n\n The word companion makes me think of dogs, so I named him Buddy.\n\n After the call, Buddy sent me a summary of everything we talked about with a detailed plan outlining the next steps.\n\n Simple things like this have been saving me hours.\n\n Everyone (myself included) talks about writing copy with AI because it sounds sexy.\n\n But what might be even cooler, is it makes the boring stuff easier.\n\n Unless you had a Minecraft addiction and were nonverbal in groups larger than 2 growing up, you probably hate automations, tracking, and summarizing data.\n\n AI makes this way less painful.\n\n Don’t overlook using it to improve your workflow, outside of writing copy.\n\n That’s only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n I break all this down (and more) for my coaching clients.\n\n If you're building an info-product agency and want to save time, make more money, and not cry while setting up Zapier... apply here. ​\n\n Gonna go play with Buddy,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

Maybe one day.\n\n But I just wanted to make enough money so that I didn’t have to ask some dickhead for a day off.\n\n “S..sss…Sir… I’m not feeling too well, can I—”\n\n I’d rather sell my body on OF.\n\n Anyway, it works.\n\n This vision that plays in the back of your mind is real.\n\n Not every guru is trying to fuck you over.\n\n There are people just like you (and probably much dumber) who’ve actualized their goals.\n\n Stop listening to the sliver of doubt that creeps into your mind whenever you’re about to take a leap.\n\n ​ Just jump. ​\n\n You’ll grow your wings on the way down…\n\n And one day, you’ll look up and realize you did it.\n\n But by then, it’ll feel normal – and you’ll know you’ve got so much further to go.\n\n Or you can ignore everything I said and just keep watching other people win:\n\n ​ (that one's crazy ⬆)\n\n ​ ​ ​ Up to you. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n​",

And yeah, that’s part of the game.\n\n But they rarely show you the late nights, identity crises, and full-blown mental spirals it took to get there.\n\n “He hit $50k/mo in 3 months” sounds a hell of a lot better than “He finally hit $50k after spending three years depressed, lost, and considering accepting the sugar baby offer in his DMs.”\n\n But I’ll give it to you straight.\n\n This game is difficult because you have to reprogram your hardwiring.\n\n You’ll get discouraged, distracted, almost quit, feel like an idiot, and then…\n\n Magic happens.\n\n I was reminded of all this yesterday when I sat down with Heik — one of the guys inside AL.\n\n He joined six months ago making $2k/month.\n\n Today, he’s doing $10k/month and just flew from Germany to Miami to meet with clients.\n\n His journey wasn’t linear or smooth.\n\n But he stuck it out – even when it felt like nothing was clicking.\n\n I wanted to share our convo with you, not because Heik’s some unicorn…\n\n But because his story is one you might see yourself in.\n\n The first $10k always takes the longest.\n\n But after that, the game gets fun.\n\n ​ Watch the interview here. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n​",

Members are crushing.\n\n And the best part of all – work doesn’t feel like a chore.\n\n Most of 2024, I wasn’t very engaged in my businesses.\n\n For the two years before that, almost all I did was work.\n\n This was great to build a foundation but life just felt dull after a while.\n\n Why would I make more money if I don’t know how to spend it?\n\n So, I learned how to make tens of thousands of dollars disappear. Fast.\n\n But I’m out of coast mode now.\n\n I feel more in control of my business, and there’s this level of fulfillment that’s met by forward progress.\n\n Scaling feels like creative problem solving rather than an intimidating headache.\n\n Instead of dreading calls and items on my to do list, I look forward to (most of) them.\n\n I like sitting down at my desk.\n\n It’d been a while since I had this type of energy and I forgot how incredible it is.\n\n So, if you’re in an era where opening your laptop feels equivalent to being stuck in a closet with Lizzo…\n\n Here’s my advice to you:\n\n First – you have to really try.\n\n Profound, right?\n\n Seriously though, it might just be difficult because you're not building any momentum.\n\n Get organized, take some baby steps, and see where you’re at in a week.\n\n For 95% of people reading this, that’s the fix.\n\n But if you’re where I was, and you can’t even bear the thought of work…\n\n You have to shake the snowglobe.\n\n I am advising you to crash out (potentially).\n\n Move to a new city, change up your routine, spend more money, try new hobbies, do ayahuasca in a forest… idk just do something different.\n\n Follow your natural curiosity.\n\n I don’t know if this is sound advice, but it worked for me.\n\n I had to sidequest-maxx to show myself how fun life can be.\n\n This made it feel like clicking buttons in exchange for a larger number on a screen is worth it again.\n\n Now, quick disclaimer:\n\n Do not take this as an excuse to crash out because you’re avoiding sending outbound messages.\n\n There will always be parts of business that aren’t fun.\n\n Sometimes the answer is to power through.\n\n There are always parts of business that suck.\n\n But here’s the truth:\n\n Inertia = resistance to change.\n\n An object at rest stays at rest. An object in motion stays in motion.\n\n So if you’re stuck…\n\n ​ Just start moving. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n​\n​",

George – no hard feelings. I found something more your speed: Careers at McDonalds. ​\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​",

And everyone is building a stupid AI tool no one wants.\n\n While most will fail, there’ll be some big winners.\n\n And those who win, will find their ideas in the trenches.\n\n They’ll be working on an optimization in their business, run into a problem, realize it’s a common problem in their industry, and build something that solves it.\n\n Next thing you know you’re Alex Becker and you just sold Hyros for $100m.\n\n The more I go down the AI rabbithole, the more I’m realizing…\n\n This may be the greatest era of opportunity in my lifetime.\n\n And an afternoon of deep work could result in a nine-figure idea.\n\n In 1994, a VP at a hedge fund noticed the internet was growing at 2,300% per year.\n\n He capitalized on this and started selling books online.\n\n And that little company became something you may have heard of – Amazon.\n\n “When I’m 80, I want to have minimized the number of regrets. I knew I might fail, but I also knew I wouldn’t regret trying.” - Jeff Bezos\n\n Anyway, I say all this not to romanticize tech or pretend I’m the next Bezos.\n\n But to remind myself (and maybe you too) that once-in-a-generation windows don’t stay open forever.\n\n You can either keep scrolling, keep judging, keep saying “AI is cringe”...\n\n ​ Or you can build. ​\n\n Your call.\n\n Ben\n\n P.S.

Banger. \n\n Second email, banger. \n\n Third, fourth, fifth… holy fuckin shit Chat GPT I love you to death. \n\n [Ok, no more southern accent]\n\n My full welcome sequence was done in three minutes.\n\n And it wasn’t some generic, AI sounding copy.\n\n The writing had a real voice, humor, and maintained the tone in my client's content.\n\n All in, it took maybe 10 minutes.\n\n Offer, lead magnet, landing page, welcome sequence.\n\n AI didn’t just help – it did the damn thing (because I used it correctly).\n\n This is the game now.\n\n If you want to build a lean info-agency using tools like this,\n\n It’s never been easier…\n\n ​ And Artisan Lab is where I show you how. ​\n\n Ben (not AI, I promise)\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​",

All I have to do is collect it.” \n\n Felix Dennis told me to say this to myself, so I figured I’d share it with you.\n\n Today I'm thinking about dumb people.\n\n More specifically, how people who are dumber than me are richer than me.\n\n That’s wack.\n\n Now I’m not a genius…\n\n I can’t change a tire, I’m severely directionally challenged, and I often misspell simple words.\n\n But everyone has their pitfalls.\n\n Strip Elon Musk of his fame and put him at LIV in Miami.\n\n He’d look like the kid who gets picked last in high school gym class. \n\n Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n Your job is to lean into what you’re good at and stop wasting time pretending to be someone you’re not.\n\n Let me show you what I mean.\n\n I have two friends – let’s call them Nikola and Anthony (Basketball fans, you already get the analogy).\n\n Nikola’s an operator.\n\n He’s analytical and calculated.\n\n Excel sheets give him an erection and he uses Zapier to automate his breakfast order and bathroom schedule.\n\n But if you put him in a room full of people, he’ll complain about how he wants to go home.\n\n He has trouble making eye contact with women and freezes up on camera.\n\n Still, he’s rich.\n\n He’s the COO of an 8 figure eCom brand.\n\n Anthony’s the opposite.\n\n He’s incredibly articulate, he can simplify complex ideas, and he loves the spotlight.\n\n But if you told him to build a funnel or set up an automation… it’d take him 6 hours, 3 breakdowns, and a YouTube tutorial.\n\n So he doesn’t.\n\n He stays on camera, grabs attention, and outsources the rest.\n\n Both are successful. Because they play their role.\n\n Most people try to “fix” their weaknesses instead of weaponizing their strengths.\n\n Don’t be like most people.\n\n Figure out your edge. Go all in on it.\n\n And if you suck at the rest, improve it or get help.\n\n ​ Now go collect what’s already yours. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

That same day, I’m adding:\n\n Another coach (now 4-5 calls/week) Extra 1-on-1 calls AI modules that’ll help you train ChatGPT to do 80% of client work If you go here and apply before June 1st, you’ll get access to everything we have now, plus the additions at the current price.\n\n But once these updates are live, there's no going back.\n\n ​ Commit a highway robbery here. ​\n\n Thing #2: Phillip made $87k last month. \n\n He can’t legally drink alcohol (he’s 20).\n\n He only has three clients.\n\n And he transitioned from high ticket sales to info-agency just four months ago.\n\n Meaning he basically went from 0-$87k/mo in four months.\n\n The kid is a DAWG.\n\n ​ So, I had him on the channel for an interview that you can watch here. ​\n\n Alright, announcements are over.\n\n Here’s a quick AI cheat code for writing email copy: \n\n Take 10-20 solid emails you like (yours, mine, etc.) Drop them in a Google Doc Feed it into ChatGPT/Claude with this prompt: “I’m going to give you example marketing emails. \n\n Your job is to extract the tone, writing style, voice, and structure used and turn it into a clear style guide and persona that I (or my team) can follow. This should be an extensive guide that we can replicate with any personal brand. \n\n Break down: \n\n Tone and personality traits \n\n Formatting and structure \n\n Common themes and messaging angles \n\n Do’s and Don’ts \n\n Example CTA styles” \n\n Now you have a custom template.\n\n Upload client info, tell the AI to follow your style guide, and boom…\n\n You’ll never have to write an email from scratch again.\n\n Enough yapping.\n\n Later,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n​\n​\n\n ​",

    "body": "Happy Memorial Day.\n\n Over the past few years, I’ve subscribed to countless newsletters.\n\n So many that I don’t remember a lot of the names I see in my inbox.\n\n But this morning, one of them stood out.\n\n They said “we’re discounting our price from $7995 to just $995 for the next 48 hours!” \n\n I understand Holidays are great excuses to run discounts – and much respect to all of those who’ve served in the military.\n\n But my brother in Christ…\n\n SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OFF?\n\n For Memorial Day??\n\n Are you gonna throw in a free hand job for customers during Christmas???\n\n Shit like that just makes me laugh.\n\n Anyway, here’s what I really wanted to talk about today:\n\n “What you’re aware of you’re in control of, what you’re not aware of controls you.” - Anthony de Mello \n\n This obviously applies to the big decisions in life.\n\n But just as important, are the small ones.\n\n You can “escape the matrix,” create your own income, and travel the world… and still be asleep at the wheel.\n\n You look free, but you’re more enslaved than the guy who’s stoked for his day off today.\n\n Here’s what’s easy to forget:\n\n Everything is a conscious decision.\n\n If you want your life to look different, you have to change it (duh).\n\n But if you don’t define what change looks like, you’ll drift.\n\n You’ll be aware enough to know something’s off, but too unclear to do anything about it.\n\n I found myself in this very position about two years ago.\n\n I’d been living in Miami for just under a year and was starting to make some real money.\n\n My income climbed from $15k/mo to $70k/mo (thanks to my Info Agency).\n\n But I wasn’t enjoying it at all.\n\n Here’s an excerpt from my journal entry in August 2023:\n\n “I feel uninspired. Almost like I was sold a lie. I go accomplish all these things, hit numbers, buy fancy shit — and my life would feel a whole lot different. But I’m here and it doesn’t live up to that.” \n\n What I didn’t understand then, was that the same way making money is a conscious decision…\n\n So was my lifestyle.\n\n I didn’t have any hobbies.\n\n I didn’t make a conscious effort to meet new people.\n\n I didn’t design my life outside of the money part.\n\n So there I was. Making more money than I knew what to do with… But no motion.\n\n And then, I regained consciousness.\n\n Started boxing. Started going out. Started playing tennis.\n\n Two months later, my lifestyle was exactly the way I envisioned.\n\n Plus I hit my first $100k month and bought my dream car.\n\n All of it came from conscious decisions…\n\n And the same system I now teach inside Artisan Lab. ​\n\n It’s what let me charge $10k+ per client, build real freedom, and actually enjoy the life I worked for.\n\n The price goes up June 1st. \n\n ​ If you’ve been waiting for a sign, this is it. ​\n\n Talk soon,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n​\n\n ​",

Price goes up in three days.\n\n If you’re even thinking about doing this, now’s the time to move.\n\n After that, it’s gonna cost more.

As a prospect.\n\n It was for Nate Schmidt’s eCom mentorship, “Boss Builder.”\n\n I paced around my childhood bedroom on the call.\n\n When we got to the pitch and he dropped the price… I hesitated.\n\n “Is there any way that I won’t succeed if I do everything in the program?” I asked.\n\n Quite a silly question, as no one has a crystal ball.\n\n But here’s how I’d answer it today, if I could talk to my 19 year old self:\n\n Yes. \n\n It’s entirely possible that you follow every step and don’t get the outcome you want.\n\n There are variables that neither me, you, or Lebron James could possibly foresee.\n\n Also possible, is that you have an easier time than most.\n\n Your first product could be a winner and next thing you know you’re sitting in the frunk of your Huracan in a Chrome Hearts hoodie.\n\n I can’t predict your future.\n\n But what I can tell you is this:\n\n If you follow a proven roadmap that’s worked for others…\n\n You show up every single day, even when you want to quit…\n\n And you don’t get discouraged if things happen slower than you’d like…\n\n Your success becomes inevitable.\n\n I didn’t end up buying that eCom program.\n\n Not because I didn’t believe in it.\n\n But because I didn’t believe in me.\n\n About a year later, I mustered up the conviction to buy an SMMA program.\n\n Fast forward to now and I’m writing this at my desk in my Miami penthouse.\n\n So no, {{ subscriber.first_name | fallback: \"friend\" }} I can’t promise you that Artisan Lab will make you rich.\n\n You will.\n\n If you’ve got the balls to commit.\n\n If you stop overthinking.\n\n And if you finally decide to bet on yourself.\n\n Not just in your head, but with your actions.\n\n Because the only thing standing between you and the life you want…\n\n Is the version of you that keeps hesitating.\n\n ​ Let him die here. ​\n\n I’ll hand you the same blueprint that changed my life and dozens of others.\n\n ​ Go here now before the price goes up at midnight.\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

Lol.\n\n But even if you did, it’ll make for a good story.\n\n Because now you’re in the arena.\n\n It takes courage to reject the opinion of the masses – the same way it takes courage to build a successful business.\n\n So, that concludes my indirect pitch.\n\n ​ Buy info, retard friend. ​\n\n Talk tm,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n\n ​",

I want to date her.”\n\n Second-order consequence:\n\n “She keyed my car, stole my Rolex and threw a chair off my balcony.”\n\n If you considered the second order consequence from the beginning, you probably wouldn’t have made decision number one.\n\n Make sense?\n\n Cool.\n\n The same principle applies to business, especially with AI.\n\n Hold on now, don't click off yet – I know you’re probably sick of those two letters.\n\n Most agency owners, copywriters, and marketers are thinking…\n\n “Oh this is really cool, AI will do my work for me hurr durr.”\n\n And what’s the reaction to this?\n\n Their clients realize they don’t need them.\n\n Low skill, basic service providers get replaced.\n\n But this doesn’t mean you’re doomed…\n\n Because high level service providers become indispensable.\n\n An online coach (or really any business owner) doesn’t need doers.\n\n They need thinkers who can identify bottlenecks, strategize, and steer the ship…\n\n While leveraging AI to improve efficiency, quality, and everything in between.\n\n In simple terms, this means…\n\n Information gets commoditized.\n\n Everyone will have the same tools.\n\n “I can build your funnel” is not a MOAT.\n\n And differentiation comes through thinking, experience, and context.\n\n People who understand psychology, systems, and nuances will use AI to multiply their impact.\n\n Everyone else will get drowned out.\n\n Pricing power shifts to those who own outcomes, not just provide services.\n\n Imagine you build and manage the entire back-end of a $200k/month info biz.\n\n You track KPIs, manage the team, improve conversions, and build the whole system.\n\n You’re not an expense, you’re a partner.\n\n And that’s why they’ll pay you $40k/mo, instead of $2k/mo.\n\n Meanwhile, the “AI agency, copywriter and arbitrageurs ” are fighting over scraps, praying someone throws them a $1,500 bone.\n\n All the tools are accessible now. The difference is the application and positioning.\n\n If you can tie yourself to revenue, AI becomes your leverage not your replacement.\n\n ​ Go here if you wanna stay ahead of the curve. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

And now, he will quite literally be set up for life.\n\n Ask yourself what you would’ve done in that position.\n\n You’re underpaid.\n\n Your income doesn’t reflect your skill set.\n\n And no one is asking you to take any initiative.\n\n Would you go above and beyond?\n\n Or would you get complacent?\n\n The answer to that question determines the rest of your life.\n\n There’s no secret.\n\n ​ Just a moment where you decide to act like the person you want to become.\n\n No pressure,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. “Opportunities are all around you, you’re just too fucking retarded to spot them.” - Socrates\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

Set precise goals.\n\n “Land one client on a 20% rev share, get them to $100k/mo.”\n\n 2. Reverse engineer it.\n\n How many outbound messages do I need to send daily to get a client?\n\n 3. Execute.\n\n Actually do it.\n\n There’s your spiritual alignment manifestation guru guide – no crystals required.\n\n Just set a goal, make a plan, and do the work.\n\n If you want to manifest $20k/month without becoming a hippy, join me here. ​\n\n Talk tomorrow,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S.

Artisan Lab’s 1 year anniversary is coming up in 2 days.\n\n I asked our members to leave a quick review and wanted to share this one from Jack: \n\n “48 hours into Artisan Lab hands down one of if not the best purchases in my life. I know I’m glazing rn but honestly wtf it’s gone to a point of over delivering. It’s not just info, it’s every single skill it takes to make money online in one package.” \n\n If only the helicopter company over delivered half as much as we do inside Artisan Lab…\n\n ​ Join us here. ​\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

I went from charging $500 per client to $7K+ upfront—and I actually own equity in a client business now.\" – Adam Wieczorek ​ \n\n \"Last month my main client did $15K. On a 50% rev share, I took home $7.5K—and it’s growing. I’ve leveraged that case study to land more clients.

Just sending a message your way to say how cool it is seeing you grow. You’re crushing it.”\n\n This was from Mike, a basketball shooting coach who I worked with a few years ago.\n\n He was one of my first few info clients.\n\n I built a low ticket ascension funnel for him in March, 2022 and ran ads for a handful of months after that.\n\n That was a pivotal era in my journey.\n\n I’d begun dropping my local business clients and replacing them with info guys.\n\n At the start of that year, I had 14 local clients and somehow only made $10k in January.\n\n By June, I had five info clients and made $16k.\n\n Three of my clients were the top personal brands in online basketball training.\n\n Another was a YouTuber with over 500k subs who I used to be a fan of.\n\n And the last was one of my best friends at the time, selling a high ticket sales coaching offer.\n\n This was phase one of my info business.\n\n I’ll refer to it as the “freelancer model.”\n\n I hadn't really tapped into rev shares yet, but I was charging higher prices.\n\n I’d offer anything copy related – emails, ads, funnels, and VSL’s.\n\n By October 2022, I got to $28k/mo this way.\n\n But two months later, I found an even better model and entered phase two…\n\n The “partner model.”\n\n This is where I went all in on rev shares.\n\n Because of that, my biggest client in December 2022 paid me $12,900.\n\n In total, I made $31k that month with just six clients.\n\n Check out what happened next:\n\n ​ This new partner model got me as high as $124k profit in one month by the end of 2023.\n\n I’d have 5-8 clients at a time, who I’d typically become friends with.\n\n Using this model, I’d make between $80k-$120k/mo for the following 12 months.\n\n Since then, I’ve entered phase 3 which I’ll call the “owner model.”\n\n Although I still have a few partner clients – I’ve built my own offer in Artisan Lab and have majority share in a couple other offers.\n\n This seems to be a common progression.\n\n You start off by offering anything you can – prove that you can be trusted to not run away after someone gives you money. \n\n Once you do that, you gain confidence in your skillset and start getting a piece of the pie.\n\n You now have a handful of clients on 10-30% rev shares.\n\n This alone can get you to $100k/mo+ as it has for me and many members in AL.\n\n I’m not saying this is the only path.\n\n But if you’re trying to escape the client hamster wheel and build something meaningful…\n\n This is the one I’d bet on.\n\n Start by doing great work for cheap Build real skill and trust Shift into higher-paying, higher-leverage partnerships Eventually own the assets yourself Three years ago, I was charging as low as $1k/mo to write emails for clients.\n\n Now I’ve had clients happily send $50k wires.\n\n If you don’t wanna wait three years to figure this out the hard way…\n\n ​ Join me here. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

Get a beer after work.\n\n Roll your eyes when you see young people on social media driving supercars.\n\n Tell yourself, “They aren’t happy! They’re victims of materialism and capitalism.”\n\n Maybe you’re right, maybe you’re coping. Doesn’t really matter.\n\n At the end of the day, this isn’t a bad life.\n\n But if you’re wired like me, you know it would drive you insane.\n\n The question “what if” would always linger.\n\n You’ll avoid looking at yourself in the mirror because you don’t want to face it.\n\n You knew you wanted more, but you got really good at pretending you didn’t.\n\n And even if on the outside it doesn’t look that bad…\n\n You’ll be miserable knowing you settled.\n\n Is that the life you want?\n\n I doubt it.\n\n I know that wasn’t as fun as visualizing a supercar and supermodel.\n\n But sometimes you need a harder push.\n\n If you want to give yourself a shot at the other life (the one you actually want)...\n\n I’ll see you Wednesday at 7pm EST. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

It tensed up and I had a tension headache all day.\n\n Plus I was stressed because I’d been procrastinating my webinar presentation.\n\n Tuesday was supposed to be the day I’d finally get it done.\n\n But looking at the computer screen hurt my eyes.\n\n So instead of doing anything productive, I laid on the floor for the majority of the day.\n\n When webby day rolled around, I had 10% of my slides ready.\n\n Plus I still had to set up all the automations, reminders, etc.\n\n Fuck me.\n\n But I powered through it.\n\n I got up at 5am, put on David Goggins playlist and got everything done by 9am.\n\n Just kidding, lol.\n\n I woke up around 8, and leisurely got ready.\n\n Still I procrastinated the slides, and started with the backend tasks that needed to be set up.\n\n Around 1pm (6 hours before I went live) I opened my Google Presentation.\n\n The good news was I had 27 slides already completed.\n\n The bad news was that I ended up with 284 slides.\n\n But I started cooking.\n\n I recently saw a video of Hunter Biden explaining what it’s like to be on crack – and now I fully understand it.\n\n Although I wasn’t on crack (to be clear), I was hearing colors and seeing sounds.\n\n The words for each slide came to me effortlessly.\n\n By 6:30pm EST (30 minutes before) I’d finished 90%.\n\n The pitch was the only thing I didn’t finish because I wanted to quickly review the training.\n\n So I said “fuck it” and just winged the pitch.\n\n And today, I’m really glad I didn’t cancel it.\n\n I had a great time, people seemed to love it, and hopefully we’ll get many new Artisan Lab members and change a lot of lives.\n\n If you were there, thanks for coming.\n\n If you weren’t, I’ll run it back at some point down the line because I’m now addicted to crack.\n\n Either way, you can get rich with me here. ​\n\n Later,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. If you registered and weren't able to attend, I have a present for you.\n\n A bunch of Europeans DM’d me and said they were busy smoking cigarettes and bumping house music since it was 1am in Ibiza.\n\n Look out for an email from me shortly titled “Since you flaked.”\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

    "body": "Good morning.\n\n Yesterday I decided I want a Ferrari 488 Pista.\n\n I’d been trying to convince myself to want a McLaren 720s, but they just look plasticy to me.\n\n The only problem is, Pistas are around $600k.\n\n That’s about double what I’d be comfortable spending right now.\n\n So… I have to make more money.\n\n After this material awakening, I began thinking about how to do that.\n\n There are three ways to grow any high ticket service or coaching business:\n\n 1. Increase traffic\n\n 2. Increase conversions\n\n 3. Increase LTV\n\n At first, traffic is the most important – without it, you don’t have a business.\n\n But conversions and LTV start to matter more once traffic is flowing.\n\n I recently helped a client launch from scratch.\n\n He started posting short form content a few months ago and quickly gained traction.\n\n We threw together a lead magnet, captured emails and nurtured them through the list.\n\n About 60 days ago, we started selling.\n\n Prospects go through a short VSL, fill out an application, and book with our sales team.\n\n We’re making some money, but our conversion rate sucks.\n\n The leads are low intent, low trust, and just don’t seem to care enough about what we’re selling.\n\n This is a good problem to have because it’s fairly easy to solve.\n\n Maybe the way we position the offer isn’t resonating.\n\n Maybe we’re selling to the wrong type of people.\n\n Maybe we simply need to bombard prospects with way more proof.\n\n Fixing this is just a matter of tests and tweaks. Here’s a few I’m exploring:\n\n – Adjusting the pitch\n\n – Adding more proof to the funnel\n\n – Increasing touch points pre-call\n\n – Swapping to a webinar\n\n – Revising our DM setting flow\n\n My job as a marketer/operator is to fuck with all of the above until numbers improve.\n\n Once they do, we can allocate more attention and focus to the other two buckets.\n\n To get more traffic, run ads and/or make more content.\n\n To increase LTV, sell more expensive shit.\n\n It’s quite simple.\n\n If you see me post in a 488 Pista in the next few months, you’ll know I found the solution.\n\n If you don’t, I’m getting there.\n\n ​ Go here if you want my help in building and/or scaling your info agency.\n\n Talk tomorrow,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n​",

Small wins will create bigger ones. You're one productive morning away from a productive day, and one productive day away from a productive week. Just have to get the ball rolling with the small things.” \n\n Soon enough you’ll get back in rhythm.\n\n The ball will hit your hands and you’ll effortlessly rise up and let it fly.\n\n Slump over, Lambo coming soon. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

The current VSL messaging attracts unqualified prospects who cannot afford your service. By implementing better qualification processes and targeting higher-quality leads, you should see immediate improvements in close rates and revenue.” \n\n Thank you Agent 0, you just saved me 22 hours of my life and gave me this cool graph:\n\n ​ You might be thinking “Wow Ben, this is incredible.

Spend a little bit of money\n\n 2. Am constantly reminded (the table is a visual cue)\n\n 3. Make it convenient and enjoyable\n\n Getting rich works the same way.\n\n In college I’d write goals and affirmations on sticky notes and place them around my room.\n\n Every time I walked into my bathroom I’d see “you are who you think you are.”\n\n Every time I sat at my desk I’d see “Ben made $10,000 this month.”\n\n I spent almost all the money I had on a coaching program.\n\n I created a ritual where I’d light a candle, put on music, and make myself this yogurt bowl when I sat down to work at night.\n\n I forced myself to do it. And I made it as enjoyable as possible.\n\n I’m writing to you from a penthouse in Miami because of this.\n\n I have liquid 7 figures because of this.\n\n The car I’ve wanted since I was 10 years old is in the garage because of this.\n\n I’m not bragging.\n\n But I’m imploring you that success is no accident.\n\n Wake up.\n\n Your problems will never fix themselves.\n\n You’re too comfortable at your current standards.\n\n You tell yourself you want to change but you do nothing about it.\n\n When are you gonna put your foot down and act, you buffoon!\n\n Don’t wait until it’s too late.\n\n Love you,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

    "body": "Today we’re talking about Baker Mayfield.\n\n If you know nothing about American football, you probably think that’s a shitty restaurant chain you’d find in a fly over state.\n\n Let me catch you up:\n\n Baker Mayfield is an NFL quarterback.\n\n He was drafted first overall to the Cleveland Browns in 2018.\n\n In his third year with the team, he led them to their first playoff win in nearly 20 years.\n\n But the following season was a disappointment.\n\n He played through an injury, the team fell apart, and they missed the playoffs.\n\n Then, Cleveland decided to make a bold move.\n\n They traded a total of six draft picks (including three first rounders) for… get this…\n\n A man with 24 counts of sexual assault against him.\n\n That man also plays quarterback, meaning they’d given up on Baker.\n\n Plus they gave Epstein Jr. the largest – fully guaranteed – contract in NFL history…\n\n 5 years, $230 million.\n\n Baker requested a trade and they sent him to another dysfunctional franchise, Carolina.\n\n He spent a year there, got benched and eventually cut from the team.\n\n After a brief stint as a backup for the Rams, it looked like he might be out of the league soon.\n\n And then…\n\n He found a better opportunity.\n\n He signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, led them to the playoffs, and was awarded Most Improved Player. \n\n Statistically speaking, he was the 4th best QB in the league last year.\n\n “Ben, why have you written 250 words glazing Baker Mayfield?”\n\n Great question, {{ subscriber.first_name | default: \"friend\" }}.\n\n Similar to business, Baker just needed the right “vehicle”.\n\n Despite having the talent and being an incredibly hard worker, he bounced from one shitty situation to the next…\n\n Until he found the right home for him.\n\n Similarly, I was once overworked, overqualified and underpaid.\n\n I was grinding away at my SMMA and just couldn’t scale.\n\n Then one day I figured… What if I just apply my skill set in a way that’ll give me more leverage?\n\n So I made the pivot to partnering with info-product sellers.\n\n Four months later, I hit my first $50k month.\n\n Six months after that, I hit $100k/mo with just seven clients.\n\n Turns out, I wasn’t the problem. My business model was.\n\n The Info Agency model became my loving home.\n\n More leverage, fewer clients, and rev shares.\n\n Plus no risk of getting replaced by a freak named Deshuan.\n\n ​ Here’s your ticket to a better vehicle. ​\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. One of my Artisan Lab members just went through a similar journey.\n\n Yahya was running a retention agency, making $2-5k/mo when he switched to info.\n\n He joined AL a little over two months ago.\n\n Yesterday, he shared this win:\n\n ​ He’ll make a lot of money from that rev share :)\n\n ​ You can join him. ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n​",

Get me some fucking double A batteries ASAP no rocky!”\n\n To your disappointment, your Mom is hammered.\n\n She caught your Dad cheating on her with your Uncle so she’s numbing the pain with two bottles of Rosé.\n\n “Dammit! She won’t be able to drive to the store,” you think to yourself.\n\n Time to take matters into your own hands.\n\n You scour the house for batteries, opening the back of every TV remote.\n\n None of them fit into your car.\n\n You’d ask your Dad for help but he’s upstairs with Uncle Timmy.\n\n So you decide to hop in his Ford F-150 and drive to the store yourself.\n\n You can barely see over the steering wheel so you grab a pipe from the garage as an extension to your foot.\n\n Next thing you know you’re pulling out of the driveway.\n\n Luckily you’ve played a lot of GTA.\n\n By some miracle, you make it to the store, find the batteries, check out, and make it back home.\n\n Finally you pop the batteries in the bottom of the car and you’re off to the races.\n\n Congrats kid.\n\n Now {{ subscriber.first_name }} you’re probably thinking...\n\n “Are you going anywhere with this or are you just telling me a fabricated, alarming story about an unsupervised child due to his alcoholic mother and gay father?”\n\n Here’s how this relates to you and your business success:\n\n Right now, you’re that toy Bugatti.\n\n If you’re a complete beginner, you have to get batteries before you can start moving.\n\n Go down Youtube rabbit holes, read books, watch courses, and start practicing your skills.\n\n The car won’t start moving yet (you won’t make any money).\n\n But you’re installing the necessary batteries that will allow you to go fast.\n\n Welcome to the trenches :)\n\n It’s impossible to say how much time you’ll spend here, but I can promise you that on the other side is everything you’ve ever wanted.\n\n Once you get through, you’ll hit the gas. ​\n\n And finally, you’ll be rewarded for all of your previously unrewarded effort.\n\n Just don’t quit before you even get the batteries.\n\n Let me know if you read this one,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

Don’t waste your luck. ​\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. Let me know if you made it all the way down here, solider. If you liked this one -- and you're enjoying the CHC's I'll make it a weekly thing.

    "body": "It’s August 25th 2025.\n\n IT’S AUGUST 25TH 2025!\n\n This year is flying by.\n\n Exactly five years ago today I started my “sophomore” year of college.\n\n “Sophomore” is in quotes because it was really a continuation of my freshman year based on credit hours.\n\n When you have a 1.1 GPA for a semester, I guess that really sets you back.\n\n But I knew I’d be out of there soon and mentally, I already was.\n\n I was only taking one class to keep my parents happy because it meant I was still enrolled.\n\n This gave me plenty of time to work on my “business.”\n\n Well, it wasn’t really a business yet but I was getting there.\n\n I was doing freelance videography, making about $1k per month — which was an interesting phase.\n\n This was my “I finally found some direction but now I’m even more lost than I was before” era.\n\n But in between bong rips and frat parties, I was grinding.\n\n The only problem was that bong rips and frat parties were a frequent occurrence, so I wasn’t growing very fast.\n\n By the end of the year I was in peak shiny object syndrome form.\n\n Between juggling a dozen situationships in college and a dozen more in half-baked businesses, I was overwhelmed.\n\n I had a few videography clients, bought an SMMA course, bought a sales course, got an appointment setter role, and quit after a day.\n\n Here were my exact words from a journal entry on Jan 8, 2021:\n\n “Feeling a little defeated. More confused, and making less money than I did prior. Ugh. Maybe this online biz thing isn’t for me… Maybe I was born to be a dreamer. Get stuck in the 9-5 with all these big ideas that never come to fruition. Maybe. Or maybe I just need to commit to something.” \n\n That last line was wise, young Ben.\n\n My two main problems were:\n\n 1. Although I was lost, life was still relatively comfortable.

Warm up: Lead magnet in the bio, built a list and started nurturing the audience further. Launch: VSL scripted and recorded, call funnel built, closer onboarded and ready. Break everything and fix it: We didn’t try to perfect the launch. We had the barebones in place for everything. Since then, we’ve revised the VSL, the funnel cycled through closers and setters, adjusted the pitch, the offer, and so on.\n\n Now our backend foundation is solid and scaling to six figure months is mostly a matter of more traffic.\n\n If it sounds like I’m over simplifying it, I’m really not.\n\n All you need is traffic, a funnel, and an offer.\n\n God bless info.\n\n Okay I gotta get on this call – Go here to see how we spawn seven figure info businesses from scratch. ​\n\n Bye,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

Forgotten banger.\n\n It took me 22 minutes to get here, although it’s only a 3 minute walk from my hotel.\n\n I asked the receptionist “What’s the best coffee shop around here?”\n\n “Jründgen ven” she said.\n\n She had a German(?) accent that seemed to only be thick when pronouncing the name of the cafe.\n\n I mostly understood the rest of her directions but wasn’t really paying attention because I was trying to make out what Jrüdgen ven was.\n\n She said something about going to the left and taking an elevator. I think.\n\n Drunken Bean!\n\n That’s what Jrüdgen ven means.\n\n Ok easy enough, I’ll just put in my trusted google maps - no need for Nazi directions.\n\n 2 minutes later I was at Drunken Bean.\n\n Well, my phone said I was. But unless it was hidden inside a fire station, the GPS was wrong.\n\n So I just started walking aimlessly.\n\n I figured I’d either finally find the elusive little bean (pun intended) or I’d stumble into a different cafe.\n\n After 15 minutes, I was basically back where I started.\n\n Just as I was about to give up and Uber to a different cafe, I looked to my right and saw…\n\n An elevator.\n\n It was practically glowing. Like when you find a gold scar in Fortnite.\n\n I didn’t know where it would take me or why it was on the middle of the sidewalk.\n\n But I knew I had to get in it.\n\n I put my faith in the elevator and finally a minute later the words, “Iced latte with vanilla. Actually make it a double, bitch” came out of my mouth.\n\n So as I sit here, trying to extrapolate a lesson from this heroic journey, here’s what I got for ya:\n\n Just move — even if you’re directionless.\n\n Your whole life was designed for you to think that you start with a map.\n\n Go through grade school, pick a major, stay the course…\n\n Internship, entry level job, marry the chubby 4, live the same day for 30 years, retire, and die.\n\n Sorry I’m being a harsh asshole.\n\n But if that sounds as miserable to you as it does to me, developing a high tolerance for uncertainty is your savior.\n\n If you want to carve your own path, you must accept that 90% of the time it’ll feel like you’re running through a dark forest with a toothbrush as your defense weapon.\n\n You’ll almost never be able to accurately predict what the next few years of your life will look like.\n\n Which is okay – as long as you’re in motion.\n\n Just keep walking, turning, looking…\n\n And eventually your golden elevator will appear.\n\n See you at the Jründgen ven.\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​",

It’s gotta be broken,” I thought.\n\n I picked it up and looked at the screen.\n\n To my surprise, it was in perfect condition. Not a single crack or dent.\n\n I sighed, put it in my pocket and got back to work.\n\n I was hoping it was damaged because then I’d have to get a new one.\n\n You might be thinking, “Ben, I thought you were rich, can’t you just buy one?”\n\n The money isn’t the issue.\n\n It’s the friction that comes with it.\n\n Getting a new phone means transferring all my data.\n\n I know this can be simple, but what if something goes wrong?\n\n That would mean I have to make a visit to one of my least favorite establishments on Earth…\n\n The Apple store.\n\n I just hate everything about it.\n\n The lights, the people, the smell…\n\n I’d walk in, go up to one of the virgins at the “genius bar” and they’d say…\n\n “Sir you need an appointment” under their COVID mask.\n\n Then I’d have to wait 30 minutes for the little genius to finish teaching a grandma how to take a photo.\n\n Finally, buddy would waddle over to me and say, “what’s the issue, pal?”\n\n The first issue is my phone doesn’t work. The second issue is you calling me “pal.”\n\n Then I’d wait for him to do whatever virgin witchcraft is necessary to set up my phone, and finally I’d be outta there.\n\n That’s just not an experience I’m willing to go through – especially when my current phone is functional.\n\n That’s why I was hoping it was broken.\n\n Because only then, would the pain of doing nothing outweigh the cost of change.\n\n In life, it’s pretty easy to be comfortable.\n\n Even if you’re fairly miserable in your current situation.\n\n If you have food on the table, a girl above a 4 who lets you hit, and there’s football on TV…\n\n It’s not that bad, right?\n\n So despite the fact that you want to change, you’re not in enough pain to sacrifice the comfort.\n\n Such is life.\n\n This is typically the part where we come to a resolution.\n\n I give you some advice that wraps it all up into a positive light.\n\n But today, the answer doesn’t come from me.\n\n It comes from how much pain you’re willing to create for yourself.\n\n Maybe that means you intentionally destroy your life.\n\n Or perhaps you just needed to throw on a David Goggins video.\n\n Hope you can figure it out!\n\n ​ I’ll be here. ​\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n​",

Make a clear daily routine with dedicated work blocks for different tasks. Highest priority tasks are first thing in the morning (duh).\n\n 2. Use tools/apps to limit distractions. Put your phone in another room – or lend it to a homeless man who’s instructed to only give it back if you give him $100 each day.\n\n 3. Understand that your negative thoughts are not reality. When you take action instead of listening to them, they lose power over you (don’t be a pussy).\n\n 4. Habits and rituals outweigh relying solely on willpower. Make “discipline” easy – give yourself a reward after completing tasks (i.e. after I send outreach, I will do crack).\n\n 5. Focus on the feeling of accomplishment after completing difficult tasks, not just the tasks themselves.\n\n Boom.\n\n Two days after I gave him this advice, he said “Guys outreach is fking easy” and closed a new client:\n\n ​ If you’re tired of breaking my record for most hours wasted in a day, go here and I’ll fix it with you inside Artisan Lab. ​\n\n Have a good weekend,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n​\n​",

    "body": "My name is Ben Bader and I’m an addict.\n\n Over the past four days, I’ve placed a total of 24 bets on NFL football.\n\n Yes, twenty four.\n\n I’m what experienced sports bettors would call a “square.”\n\n A square is defined as “a casual bettor who follows gut feelings, popular opinion, or media hype rather than doing sharp analysis.” \n\n Bingo!\n\n The online betting platforms love me.\n\n If you want to know exactly what you shouldn’t do, just look at their advertising.\n\n All popular sportsbooks heavily promote parlays – A parlay is a single bet that links two or more wagers together.\n\n Meaning for you to win, multiple things have to occur.\n\n It's higher risk, but on the odd chance that you effectively guess correctly, it’s a thrill.\n\n Just imagine…\n\n You’re sitting on the couch watching a game you normally wouldn’t give a shit about.\n\n There’s two minutes left.\n\n One team’s leading by 17, so it’s basically over anyways.\n\n But not for you, you piece of shit degenerate.\n\n You bet on the Texans third string wide receiver to have over 2 receptions.\n\n It’s the last leg of your parlay.\n\n All you need is number 81 to catch one more inconsequential pass and you’ll turn $100 into $925.\n\n It would make up for the 12 other bets you placed that missed today.\n\n Your eyes are glued to the TV.\n\n The Texans run the ball.\n\n “Why the fuck are you running the ball!? You’re down 17 with a minute 24 on the clock!” you yell, somehow not knowing they can’t hear you.\n\n And then, with 19 seconds left in the game, it happens.\n\n The quarterback throws the ball across the middle to number 81 for 7 yards.\n\n It’s a meaningless play, the clock runs out, and the Texans lose.\n\n But it meant everything to you.\n\n That single catch means you’re not only back to breakeven, but you’re in the green!\n\n One event made up for all of your losses.\n\n Business is the same way — especially in the beginning.\n\n Most days it’s just pain.\n\n One loss after another, your hard work is unrewarded, you want to quit…\n\n But then…\n\n After 3 months of sending outbound messages with no luck, you get a banger client.\n\n After posting 150 videos that flop, you go viral and it explodes your business.\n\n After approaching 7,321 women in the street, one finally doesn’t run away.\n\n You need to adopt the mindset of the addicted gambler.\n\n They will not stop.\n\n The hole will get deeper and deeper…\n\n Until one day…\n\n ​ One win makes up for everything. ​\n\n TOUCHDOWN!\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. This is not an endorsement of sports betting. If you’re gonna gamble, only do so with a sum you’re comfortable losing.\n\n P.P.S. Justin Jefferson any time TD, Caleb Williams O 218.5 passing yards, Rome Odunze any time TD (not financial advice).\n\n ​\n​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n​\n​\n​",

Still improbable.\n\n Then with just two minutes left in the game, Rome Odunze scored.\n\n Oh shit.\n\n I’d sort of given up on the bet by halftime but it looks like it might hit.\n\n Those two legs were the underdogs.\n\n The bet with the highest statistical probability was the only one left.\n\n With just 5 seconds to go, Caleb Willliams is 17 yards shy of the magic 219 number.\n\n Sooo you’re saying there’s a chance…\n\n The Bears have one play to go the length of the field.\n\n They snap the ball, Williams throws for 8 yards.\n\n The ball gets lateraled to a different player who runs for another 13.\n\n That’s 21 yards!\n\n Game over, parlay hits…\n\n Right?\n\n Uhhh, no.\n\n Officially, Caleb only gets credit for 8.\n\n Lateral yards don’t count for passing stats.\n\n So he finished the game with 210 yards.\n\n Just 9 short of the magic number that would’ve turned our $100 bet into $1,200.\n\n That’s the painful beauty of a parlay.\n\n Being “close” yields you nothing means nothing.\n\n You can’t carry any momentum into the next bet.\n\n But in business, you can.\n\n When you’re nine yards short in business, it means you’re learning.\n\n Your outreach is sharper.\n\n Your content is starting to hit.\n\n You’re stacking reps and getting closer to gold.\n\n Every near miss is just proof that you’re on the right track.\n\n Keep going…\n\n And go here if you want me in your corner.\n\n Ben\n\n ​ ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

That.\n\n This way of thinking is for the mentally enslaved.\n\n But you {{ subscriber.first_name }}, as a reader of the best newsletter on the internet, deserve better…\n\n You owe yourself better.\n\n When you’re quick to make compromises, here’s what happens:\n\n Your Ferrari dreams turn into a Corolla (or perhaps you buy a corvette C8 when you’re 68 and try to convince yourself it’s a real supercar).\n\n Your supermodel wife turns into a plus sized hand model. Or your “rich husband” turns into a guy that makes $105k/yr and loves to say he makes six figures.\n\n Your dream of waking up to the sound of the waves crashing on the shore only happens 3 days a year. And you’re on vacation in Myrtle Beach, not Honolulu.\n\n I know this sounds a bit dramatic, but making compromises when it comes to your desires is a slippery slope.\n\n You need to be militant.\n\n You need to be stubborn.\n\n You need to aim for what you actually want.\n\n When others tell you to be reasonable, or when you begin to hear a voice in your head negotiating with you, shut it out.\n\n I’d rather be an insane, unreasonable, stubborn asshole than a chubby balding middle aged man… in a COROLLA!\n\n Do not tolerate behavior that doesn’t align with your goals.\n\n When you make a plan, stick to it as if you are following orders from God.\n\n There is no negotiating, there is no settling, and when you find yourself exchanging “great” for “good enough,” stop yourself.\n\n If you compromise, I guess I’ll send you a postcard from Honolulu.\n\n That’s basically the real thing isn’t it! LOL!\n\n No. Stop.\n\n It’s not the real thing. And a C8 isn’t a supercar. And fuck Mrytle Beach.\n\n Their rules and standards are meant to be broken. Yours aren’t.\n\n See you in a Ferrari with a supermodel in your passenger seat.\n\n To the stubborn and unreasonable – I will help you win. ​\n\n Nature loves courage,\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. I’d feel slightly irresponsible by not clarifying some nuance here.\n\n Not compromising doesn’t mean you refuse to turn up the temperature when you set it at 67 and your girl wants it at 72.\n\n It also doesn’t mean that there is only one way to accomplish a goal and the route can’t be adjusted.\n\n But when it comes to the real shit you want…\n\n Don’t let anyone talk you out of it (including yourself).\n\n ​ This is for those who refuse to compromise. ​\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

Not for a greater purpose. But for me.\n\n I wanted to escape the inevitable future pain of mediocrity.\n\n Is that selfish? Sure.\n\n But had I deluded myself into believing that I needed a stronger “why,” perhaps I never would’ve started.\n\n I could’ve rationalized, “I’m not motivated and I can’t work because my life is decent as it is.”\n\n Don’t let Simon Sinek (author of It Starts With Why ) fool you.\n\n Your “why” can be ripping an SVJ through the Hollywood hills.\n\n Your “why” can be having the autonomy to wake up at noon every day.\n\n Your “why” can be club-hopping in Ibiza with a bunch of ungrateful models.\n\n My point is stop worrying about your fucking “why” and make money.\n\n Do you want to be miserable?\n\n Do you want to be poor?\n\n Do you want to be an incel?\n\n No?\n\n Okay! Then what the fuck else are you gonna do with your time? Lol.\n\n Eventually, your motivating factors will naturally evolve.\n\n Once you check off the superficial desires, perhaps your focus will shift to retiring your parents, setting up future generations, or saving the Goddamn turtles.\n\n But right now, you probably don’t care much about any of that.\n\n If you’re honest with yourself, you just don’t want to worry about spending money.\n\n And that’s completely fine.\n\n You don’t need to find some moral justification to stay motivated.\n\n It’s okay to want something, simply because you want to prove to yourself that you can get it.\n\n ​ Ready to get rich now? ​\n\n See you at the top,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​",

No motion. And a Toyota Corolla.\n\n That night, I chose the bong rip and pushed this existential crisis to tomorrow.\n\n That was a dangerous decision I made more times than I should’ve.\n\n But luckily I snapped out of it.\n\n I’ve wrestled this tendency to drift for years.\n\n And I won just enough times to get me here.\n\n So I guess my lesson for you today is this:\n\n You don’t have to be perfect.\n\n You don’t have to sacrifice everything.\n\n And you don’t even need a David Goggins poster on your wall.\n\n You just need to notice when you’re misaligned – and have the courage to do something about it.\n\n Those moments when you hear that voice inside – that’s a breaking point.\n\n It first whispers, “this isn’t what you want. What are you doing?”\n\n Ignore it long enough and it yells…\n\n “Wake the fuck up!”\n\n If you hear that voice, you’re one of the lucky ones.\n\n You haven’t let the world beat the light out of you yet.\n\n But it’s up to you to follow it.\n\n So here I am.\n\n Twenty-five, no chest hair, still spelling “restaurant” wrong.\n\n But I’m grateful I listened to that voice in my head a few times more than I ignored it.\n\n Because those few decisions compounded into the life I get to live now.\n\n If you take anything from this ramble, let it be this:\n\n Your intuition is a compass.\n\n Most people bury it under weekends and half naked women on social media.\n\n If you can keep yours alive and actually act on it…\n\n You’ll end up somewhere worth being.\n\n Here’s to the next 9,131 days.\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. This Wednesday at 7pm EST I’m running a free live training where I’ll show you how to use AI to land, operate, and scale with info-product clients.\n\n Instead of stacking tiny retainers, you’ll learn how to close clients that can pay you $10k+/mo.\n\n ​ Register here. ​\n\n ​\n​\n​\n\n ​\n​\n​",

Yes, six seven.\n\n Since then, he hit his first $10k month.\n\n He had zero previous experience.\n\n I wish I could take full credit for his success but I can’t.\n\n Sure I gave him a roadmap…\n\n 5 weekly coaching calls.\n\n Countless hours of course content.\n\n 1-1 support, a community full of winners, and everything he could possibly need to hit $10k/mo as fast as possible.\n\n But he was the one who executed.\n\n I can’t take credit for that.\n\n The 90-day $10k promise is highly unlikely.\n\n But Shaeis proved it can happen.\n\n He didn’t wait until he felt ready.\n\n He got in the game, took consistent action, and figured it out.\n\n That’s the difference.\n\n If you want a shot at being one of those rare outliers, you can join us here. ​\n\n Talk soon,\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n​\n​\n\n ​",

Taxes. And closers becoming successful operators.\n\n Ben\n\n P.S. The price of Artisan Lab is increasing in about a week.\n\n I’ll share more details soon, but if you want to lock in the lowest rate, now’s the time to move. ​\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n​\n​",

His assistant answers.\n\n I can’t remember exactly what we said but it was something along the lines of:\n\n “Hey we’re not actually interested in buying jewelry from you but we saw you’re starting coaching. We run marketing and operations for info-product businesses.”\n\n Somewhat surprisingly, it went well.\n\n The assistant told us they were looking for someone to help.\n\n A few hours later we got on zoom with the assistant and the main personal brand guy.\n\n We pitched him on building out the whole launch.\n\n Sales page, webinar, backend tech and set up.\n\n $15k plus 10% of cash collected.\n\n He says yes – but we only get paid (including the set up fee) once everything's built out.\n\n Let’s do it. If we get scammed at least it’ll make a good story.\n\n We sprint to build everything.\n\n Two weeks later it’s launch day.\n\n We make $50k from one post and a couple emails.\n\n Another $100k over the next few days.\n\n And just like that, a $30,300 wire was sent to my bank account.\n\n 22 days from the time we cold called him to the time we got paid.\n\n That’s fast money.\n\n Will that happen for you?\n\n Probably not. At least not right away.\n\n But the only reason it could happen for me was because I’d found the right vehicle – the same one that allowed:\n\n Yahya to make $75k in a single month from his first client.\n\n Khesraw to go from $500/mo with 10 clients to $30k/mo from one (while living in Afghanistan).\n\n Kareem, who hit $36k/mo in three months.\n\n You can join the winning team here… \n\n Or wait until the price increases tomorrow night at 11:59pm.\n\n Up to you :)\n\n Ben\n\n ​\n​\n\n ​\n\n ​\n​\n​\n​",

Make it fun. \n\n That sounds like a slogan for a condom brand.\n\n Discipline only takes you so far, but systems can carry you for miles.\n\n It’s kind of like being an NFL quarterback.\n\n Even if you’re a great player – if you're not in the right scheme talent only goes so far.\n\n But an average player in the right scheme…\n\n He can win a Superbowl – like Jalen Hurts and the Eagles last year.\n\n Build systems so you don’t heavily rely on how you feel\n\n That’s where the awareness in step one really matters.\n\n It’s not about journaling or overanalyzing your childhood trauma.\n\n It’s just figuring out what’s not working, then building systems that make the right thing easier to do.\n\n Audit > adjust > execute.\n\n And just like that, I’ve spent 27 minutes cosplaying as James Clear here so I gotta go.\n\n But before I do:\n\n Artisan Lab’s price goes up tonight at 11:59pm EST. \n\n If you book a call before then, you’ll still be locked in at the current rate.\n\n If you don’t, I will send the mafia after you. \n\n Clocks ticking ;) \n\n Ben\n\n P.S.
