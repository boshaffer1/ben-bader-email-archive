Remember when you were chasing what you have right now?\n\nBut now it just feels so normal… there was no mystical point of arrival.\n\nBefore I turn this into some corny \"be grateful\" type email, the couple next to me got like 4 different entrees, and shorty just got up to order more.\n\nBreakfast is a scam. Anyone that claims to be hungry before noon literally just has no self-control. They're just bored and would rather get up and waddle to the local woofery rather than do anything productive with their lives.\n\nIf you're reading this while taking a bite of your warm little pancake breakfast at 11 am, spit it out. And unsubscribe. You're not welcome here.\n\nYou can have coffee before noon. That's it.\n\nSeriously fasting will help your focus so much. We've all been psyop'd by big breakfast into believing that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and it's simply not true.\n\nI think fat people should have to pay extra taxes too.\n\nOh my god, this bitch to the left is taking more pictures of their FIFTH entree.\n\nSorry, I'm gonna kill someone.\n\nImagine one day I'm running some really big public company, and someone just screenshots the last few lines of this email.\n\n[CEO says, \"fat people should pay extra taxes.\"] What a headline.\n\nOk, I've gotta get to work. I know this was schizo as fuck, so hopefully, I at least made you giggle on this beautiful Monday morning.\n\nHave a great day (unless you ate breakfast),\n\nBen",

Your job doesn't care about you! The government is trying to kill you…\n\nAaaand if you want to protect yourself from these things, you need to build a social circle! Pick up my program, How to stop being a bubble-blowing clown-loving burger-flipping idiot loser, today.\"\n\nMoving on…\n\nI've been thinking about how all stages of our lives eventually become mostly-happy memories.\n\nEven the darker stages.\n\nWhen I look back on times when I was super stressed out or down bad, it's with nothing but gratitude.\n\nThe word gratitude has become so corny, but I can't think of a synonym, so you're gonna have to bear with me.\n\nThe things that once brought me turbulence all seem so minuscule now.\n\nI encourage you to audit your life as well.\n\nMost people just sleepwalk through this whole thing.\n\nPause to analyze the things that you're stressing about and understand that all things are temporary. Good or bad.\n\nYou'll probably look back at this period in your life with amusement for the person you once were and appreciation for who you've become.\n\nI'm doing this right now.\n\nA few moments ago, I had to google whether it was \"bare with me\" or \"bear with me.\"\n\nApparently, it was the latter.\n\nNow I know… silly old me.\n\nSpeaking of silliness…\n\nA handful of my friends around my same age have gotten married, and some even popped out a kid or two.\n\nIn no way am I hating on them, but this is just an absolute mindfuck to me.\n\nLike how are you possibly mature enough to know you want to spend the rest of your life with a 20ish-year-old girl?\n\nWhat if she gets a wrinkle? Or clogs your toilet? Or even worse… you discover she likes pineapple on her pizza???\n\nMaybe I'm missing something, but these are all dealbreakers for me.\n\nAnd I don't think I'm anywhere close enough to figuring out this life thing the way I'd want to in order to feel ready to share a bed with someone for the rest of time.\n\nI could be immature. Idk man.\n\nIf you're still here, hit reply and lmk what you think. How does one decide they're ready to get married and have kids?\n\nAnd if girls don't poop, why do they spend so much time in the bathroom?\n\nThe world may never know.\n\nSee ya,\n\nBen",

Pleasure to have you.\n\nI'll fill you in real quick.\n\nOn November 10th, 2022, I set out to write a daily email to my subscribers for 100 days straight.\n\nToday marks day 116 in a row.\n\nCrazy right?\n\nI've written an email every day for the last 116 days, which is even more than I originally set out to do. You should feel horrible about yourself.\n\nOnly the thing is, today is day 14.\n\nI took a long hiatus after day 9 and have been writing a few emails a week for the last week or so. Consider me your fun uncle. Sometimes I disappear for while but when I'm around it's a great time.\n\nNow that you're all caught up let's get down to business…\n\nIn college, I used to take chops a few nights a week.\n\nIf you don't know what a chop is, it's when you put weed and tobacco in a bong and clear it in one hit.\n\nIt's the craziest head rush a few dollars worth of weed and a fifth of a light blue American Spirit can buy.\n\nThe thing about chops is they're not entirely pleasant.\n\nYou usually start spinning and feel like you're gonna throw up. Or you end up drooling all over yourself.\n\nBut if you can get over that phase, the buzz is completely and utterly unmatched.\n\nImagine all of the lights in your brain just shutting off for a fleeting moment. It's like you transport into the mind of a 20-year-old blonde sorority girl.\n\nI'm telling you this because chops offer a perfect analogy for life.\n\nThe lows allow you to appreciate the highs (literally).\n\nLook at child celebrities and kids that made it big in crypto.\n\nMost of them go insane because they were handed everything too quickly. I'm sure it's fun at the beginning, where you're just able to fuck off for a bit.\n\nBut what happens when that kind of stuff gets old?\n\nSurely nothing can give you the same kind of dopamine high that you get when you turn $1,000 into $10m on some meme coin of a dog.\n\nRight?\n\nMaybe I'm just jealous.\n\nAnyway, I gotta go scam little kids on the internet.\n\nHit reply if you're new here, and tell me your favorite color or something.\n\nTalk soon,\n\nBen",

Right now you occupy your time with stuff that you pretend matters so you live a life that doesn't feel pointless.\n\nBut,\n\nWhat you stress about is meaningless.\n\nAnd so is anything you accomplish.\n\nHere's why:\n\nLet's say you solve the money problem.\n\nYou wake up tomorrow, refresh your banking app, and 100 million dollars are in your savings account.\n\nYou now have the biggest problem you've ever had in your entire life.\n\nYou have to figure out what you really want.\n\nI'm writing to you because my 3 year old dog, Tucker got diagnosed with a kidney disease today and he has around a year to live.\n\nThis all made me think about how everyones clock is ticking. One day, everyone I love and everyone you love will be gone.\n\nAs bad as it sounds, imagine if that's one of your (human) family members.\n\nEverything you're working on or stressing about, all becomes white noise.\n\nAnd now you feel like an idiot for neglecting some relationships in order to get the next dopamine hit.\n\nIf we spend all our time chasing these numbers on a screen…\n\nWe'll miss the entire time that the people (and dogs) we loved were here.\n\nWhich is the point of it all.\n\nWhen my loved ones die, I don't want to feel like I left anything on the table...\n\nIf you're still reading I'm glad you've joined me for todays spiritual enlightenment.

If you're still here reading and any of this made sense to you, hit 'reply' and let me know because I thrive off of your validation.\n\nAnyway, I ate an edible 39 minutes ago and it seems as though it's starting to hit me.\n\nIn order to maintain the legibility and keep the schizophrenia levels to a minimum on this email, I'm gonna end it here.\n\nGoodnight Adam,\n\nBen",

Kind of tired of doing the same thing everyday and I'm ready to get out of here.\"\n\nMany of my friends are about to graduate.\n\nThey think the new experience of getting a job and moving to a different city will paint their life with excitement.\n\nAnd it might for a little bit.\n\nBut in a couple years that new routine and new city will once again become mundane and they'll tell themself the same old lie that they just need to change their environment.\n\nThey refuse to ever consider the possibility that the circumstances are not the problem.\n\nThey are the problem.\n\nYou're probably the problem in your own life too.\n\nI know I am.\n\nI was addicted to basketball from the age of 9 to 17.\n\nI was sneaking into the gym to workout, always watching film, I even bought a mental performance course from a guy named Taylor Allan.\n\nBut all that work I put in never really showed in games.\n\nI was a decent player, I started my junior and senior seasons in high school, but I never dominated the way I knew I could've.\n\nAnd there was always an excuse.\n\nMy coach wouldn't let me play the way I wanted, my teammates didn't work together, my shoes felt weird, I was hungry, the defender kept grabbing me, etc…\n\nThere's one constant variable here and it was me.\n\nI was the problem.\n\nI couldn't get out of my own head and just play.\n\nMost of what you want lies on the other side of getting out of your own way.\n\nStop blaming anything and everything that you're not where you want to be.\n\nAnd don't buy a Herman Miller chair just because your favorite guru has one.\n\nLove you,\n\nBen",

She asked him the same question.\n\nHe told her how exuberant she is. How she lights up a room. And how she's never afraid to speak her mind.\n\nShe prodded a little more by asking him what things that he doesn't like about her.\n\nHe told her that she has questionable decision making when it comes to her friends… and that the reason she was in the hospital is because a few of her friends got in a fight, she ended up in the middle of it and hit her head on the concrete.\n\nThe next day another one of her friends walks in. She describes Sarah as loud and crazy. She says that Sarah is hilarious but sometimes doesn't know when to stop and that's why the fight started. She goes on to tell Sarah that she instigated the fight and describes the sequence of events leading up to it.\n\nHow can this be?\n\nAll 3 descriptions that she's received sound like they could be 3 completely different people.\n\nShe wonders who is lying to her and why. But What Sarah doesn't realize is that each persons' reality is colored by their perception, made up of their own unique previous experiences.\n\nHence the disconnect.\n\nIn their minds they weren't lying.\n\nThink the same concept holds true in your life?\n\nDoes your mom know the same version of you that your friends do?\n\nMaybe. Maybe not.\n\nTruthfully when I read this, I didn't really know what to make of it.\n\nMy best attempt at describing the message of this story would be something along the lines of…\n\nStop caring so much about what other people think about you. Their opinion is more so a reflection of them than it is an all-encompassing description of you.\n\nYou know who you are when you're alone. Bring out that true authentic version of yourself no matter who you're around – within reason.\n\nThe best person you can be is you. Because that's what separates you from everyone else.\n\nSomething to think about.\n\nChat tomorrow Adam… if that's even your real name.\n\nBen",

I’d watch Youtube videos, read books, buy a\r\ncourse or two, etc.\r\n\r\nThen I’d write a bunch of sample copy for brands or people that I\r\nfind interesting and make that my “portfolio.”\r\n\r\nStep 3: Ask strangers if you can work for them.\r\n\r\nThis one’s pretty straightforward. I’d find people that are\r\nselling things on the internet and I’d try to start a\r\nconversation with them.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning I wouldn’t mind working for cheap or even free\r\nto get some experience under my belt.\r\n\r\nIt’s really that simple folks.\r\n\r\nIf you’re in a position where you want to make money online and\r\nyou’re a decent writer, my friend Mason is hosting a free\r\ncopywriting class tonight.\r\n\r\nHe’ll teach you how to make a lot of money as a copywriter (even\r\nif you look like a 12 year old boy and you need a step stool to\r\nget into your truck).\r\n\r\n​Register for the class here and tell him I sent you.

I was going in the wrong\r\ndirection but didn’t know where else to turn…I was completely\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nI’m sitting in my childhood bedroom as I pull out my computer and\r\nstart typing.\r\n\r\nFor the last 6 months, I’ve been pretending to be someone I’m\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nI’ve gotten so good at acting like I’m happy to the point that\r\nI’m starting to forget what it actually feels like.\r\n\r\nMy fingers hit the keyboard as I write,\r\n\r\n“Never in my life have I felt this lost. I have always had\r\nsomething that I’m working toward, with an end goal in sight.\r\nThis made it easy to get up every day and spend most of my time\r\ndoing things that I thought would bring me closer to that goal.\r\nBut what happens now?”\r\n\r\nI wrote this in January 2020 while on winter break, after\r\nfinishing my first semester of college with a 1.1 GPA.\r\n\r\nAbout a year later, I got my first paying client for my lead gen\r\n“agency” - a basketball trainer in Long Island.\r\n\r\nOver the next 12 months, I built my brand as a marketer in the\r\nbasketball training space when a trainer with a big personal\r\nbrand asked me if I could help him sell his online products.\r\n\r\nI’d only run Facebook ads for local basketball training\r\nbusinesses at the time, a completely different (& easier) game\r\nthan marketing for info-products.\r\n\r\nSo naturally I said, “Sure, of course I can help. I’m an expert!”\r\n\r\nI started running his Facebook ads, writing emails, and building\r\nfunnels for him.\r\n\r\nAnd although I had little idea what I was doing…\r\n\r\nIt worked.\r\n\r\nI’d made him a few hundred grand over the next 6 months, which\r\nwas a big win considering he had almost zero prior success with\r\nonline training.\r\n\r\nThis led me to start working with 3 of the other big personal\r\nbrands in the space, and it’s how I learned the ins and outs of\r\npaid ads, copywriting, and all things info-product related.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, I started taking on clients outside of the bball\r\nniche.\r\n\r\nMy first big wins for clients came through webinars and offer\r\nlaunches.\r\n\r\nBecause I’ve built a versatile skillset, the scope of work\r\nchanges from client to client, but in most cases, I built out a\r\nnew funnel for a client, script their VSL or webinar, and then\r\nhelp them launch the offer to their email list & on socials.\r\n\r\nDepending on the offer and size of their personal brand, we may\r\nstart running paid ads if it seems like a good fit after the\r\ninitial launch.\r\n\r\nMost of my deals consist of an upfront investment anywhere from\r\n$5k - $15k and then around 10% of the revenue we generate.\r\n\r\nA year ago, my biggest client paid me $2,000 per month.\r\n\r\nToday, I’ve had singular clients pay me over $20,000 in a month.\r\n\r\nAll because:\r\n\r\n* I stopped working with broke people.\r\n* I pick clients that have a lot of leverage I can help them\r\ncapitalize on.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you liked this style of email and are more\r\ninterested in learning more about how my business works.\r\n\r\nI kinda like spewing autistic nonsense better, but if enough of\r\nyou reply with questions, I can make an appeasement.\r\n\r\nHappy Sunday,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum20qvx9u6hrw7q60u5 )\r\n| Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum20qvx9u6hrw7q60u5 )\r\n| 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum20qvx9u6hrw7q60u5/reh8hoh02zzn72t2/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

What’s the Ben Bader story?\r\n\r\nI figured I’d start here to help anyone that’s new get caught up.\r\n\r\nLong story that I don’t have the mental capacity to recite. I’m\r\n22 (and still waiting for my brain to fully develop). Here are\r\nsome recent highlights:\r\n\r\n- Dropped out of College of Charleston after 2 years.\r\n\r\n- Made my first $100k with a marketing agency for basketball\r\ntrainers.\r\n\r\n- Transitioned to info-products, and now I help big personal\r\nbrands and “influencers” make more money with their courses and\r\ncoaching.\r\n\r\n- Now living in Miami high rise with a bunch of other idiot\r\nmonkeys that make a lot of money.\r\n\r\n- I also am severely addicted to Zyns.\r\n\r\n2. How do you find clients to work for?\r\n\r\nI talk shit on Twitter and have built a bit of a brand there. I\r\nshare results, and people come to me inbound.\r\n\r\nI also get a lot of referrals and work with my close friends.\r\n\r\n3. Since you can work from anywhere, why Miami? Long-term to\r\nstay there or move somewhere else, or even buy a second\r\nhome/apartment somewhere?\r\n\r\nAll of my friends are here. Good weather. Parents have a condo an\r\nhour and a half north. Great place to meet other young\r\nentrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nI'll likely be in South Florida for a while… not sure how long\r\nit’ll be Miami.\r\n\r\nDon’t think I’d get a second place any time soon unless it were\r\nnecessary for biz, or I fall in love with some random girl that\r\nlives in bumble fuck Idaho or something lol.\r\n\r\n4. If you were 19 years old and trying to get to $10-15k a month\r\nas quickly as possible, what would you do?\r\n\r\nIf female: OnlyFans.\r\n\r\nIf male: Learn a high-value skill, pitch a fuck ton of people,\r\nget a client, repeat.\r\n\r\nIt’s really that simple.\r\n\r\nSend enough cold messages, connect with enough people, and hack\r\nyour way into different groups… you’ll find clients.

    "body": "One day during my sophomore year of high school, I was talking\r\nabout confidence with a teammate on my basketball team.\r\n\r\nHis name is Colin, and he’s probably reading this email along\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nIn that conversation, he said something that stuck with me to\r\nthis day - hence the email.\r\n\r\nI’d asked him how he seemed so unbothered when he missed shots.\r\n\r\nHe replied, “My confidence isn’t a rollercoaster.”\r\n\r\nColin went on to become the all-time leading scorer at our\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nI was on a walk today thinking about this idea of unwavering\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nAs I write this email, I’m wrestling with where it comes from.\r\n\r\nWe can all agree that a large part of confidence is derived from\r\npreparation – but it’s not that black and white.\r\n\r\nI was obsessed with basketball throughout high school.\r\n\r\nI put in as many hours as anyone.\r\n\r\nBut when I’d miss a few shots, I’d start to hesitate.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned the ball over, I didn’t want it the next play.\r\n\r\nMy confidence didn’t run parallel to my preparation.\r\n\r\nIt fluctuated. And when I’d get into a rut, it’d be a downward\r\nspiral.\r\n\r\nBut Colin was almost always emotionless.\r\n\r\nGood game, bad game, didn’t matter.\r\n\r\nHe could miss every shot and still want the ball in his hands\r\nwith the game on the line.\r\n\r\nMaybe the recipe for unwavering confidence goes as follows:\r\n\r\nPreparation - emotion = confidence…\r\n\r\nEh. I still think there’s something missing.\r\n\r\nThere’s an element of confidence that doesn’t rely on\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nIt’s built on trust.\r\n\r\nOk, wait, that makes sense.\r\n\r\nYou just watched me hash this out in real-time, so thanks for\r\nyour patience.\r\n\r\nPeople that have unwavering confidence aren’t prepared for every\r\nsituation – but they have enough trust in themselves to figure it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nI could go down the rabbit hole of where that trust comes from,\r\nbut that would take a lot more critical thinking on my end, and\r\nyou’re not really helping here.\r\n\r\nThis newsletter was never supposed to offer profound advice or\r\nlife lessons anyway.\r\n\r\nThere’s enough advice out there. I’d rather offer you my\r\nperspective and let you agree or disagree.\r\n\r\nLast thing I’ve internalized recently:\r\n\r\nYour reality acts as a mirror of your self-beliefs.\r\n\r\nIt’s a common saying in sales that “whoever has the most\r\ncertainty wins.”\r\n\r\nThis couldn’t be more true, and it doesn’t just apply to sales.\r\n\r\nIf your beliefs about yourself aren’t strong, other people's\r\nbeliefs about you will start to manifest.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t feel respected by those around you, it's because you\r\ndon’t respect yourself.\r\n\r\nChoose who you are, or let others choose for you.\r\n\r\nSounds simple, but something to consider in your own life.\r\n\r\nThat’s all for today.\r\n\r\nTalk next quarter,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/e5uxd6r2vzs7hp08rgqs8 )\r\n| Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/e5uxd6r2vzs7hp08rgqs8 )\r\n| 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/e5uxd6r2vzs7hp08rgqs8/e0hph7h0lkxq8vf8/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

It helped me connect with people who\r\nbecame friends and eventually clients.\r\n\r\nThe skills I’ve picked up have been a byproduct of me telling\r\npeople I knew how to do things that I didn’t actually know how to\r\ndo until I figured it out on the fly.\r\n\r\nI get to rely on warm inbound leads, my website sucks, I don’t\r\nuse a CRM, and my offer isn’t easily replicable for each client.\r\n\r\nI’m doing everything wrong, but business feels easy.\r\n\r\nAnd I think it’s because I’ve done the hard things right.\r\n\r\nIt’s taken me multiple years to build my Twitter presence and\r\nbecome a marketing “expert.”\r\n\r\nAnd now everything is coming to a perfect storm.\r\n\r\nMy network is bigger, and I have the skills/ experience to meet\r\nthe opportunity.\r\n\r\nIf I tried to teach someone how to do it the exact way I’ve done\r\nit, it’d take a while.\r\n\r\nIf they wanted quick success, I’d tell them to do a bunch of\r\nthings that I don’t currently have to do.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to eventually stumble into a high-leverage\r\nposition the way I have, do the following:\r\n\r\n* Post more content & don’t be a dork about it\r\n* Connect with cool people and be genuine\r\n* Say yes to any project that comes your way & learn as much as\r\nyou can\r\n* Do everything in your power to get amazing results for clients\r\n* Post more content about those results\r\n\r\nThere’s your simple 5-step system.\r\n\r\nReply if you have questions, and I’ll get back to you within 337\r\nbusiness days.\r\n\r\nSweet dreams,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. I’m taking on 5 students for coachi– lmao imagine if I just\r\nplugged a coaching offer after basically telling you how you’re\r\ntoo retarded to do what I do like an absolute asshole.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u0kgn5wzhvh83dklga6 )\r\n| Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u0kgn5wzhvh83dklga6 )\r\n| 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u0kgn5wzhvh83dklga6/3ohphkh72zk7p8ur/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "I planned this email out in my head earlier today.\r\n\r\nBut right now, I’m hesitating to write it.\r\n\r\nI was gonna tell you about how the need for confidence becomes a\r\ncrutch.\r\n\r\nI had a story prepared that demonstrated this example perfectly.\r\n\r\nI was gonna tell you how I was sitting at lunch today when I saw\r\na pretty wooman walking by.\r\n\r\nInstinctually I thought, “I should go up to her,” but I didn’t.\r\n\r\nMy brain came up with a thousand reasons as to why that’d be an\r\noutrageous thing for me to do, and I talked myself out of it.\r\n\r\nI told myself I didn’t have the confidence to do that right now.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t wearing a watch.\r\n\r\nI was dressed like a toddler.\r\n\r\nIt was a bad hair day.\r\n\r\nMaybe I’ll do it another day when I’ve done the inner work to\r\nbuild up my confidence, and I look a little more presentable.\r\n\r\nSo I let the opportunity pass me by, and now I’ll never be able\r\nto impregnate this pretty stranger. She could’ve been my wife.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, it wasn't confidence that I was lacking.\r\n\r\nIt was courage.\r\n\r\nAnd having the courage to act in the face of uncertainty is how\r\nyou build confidence.\r\n\r\nIt lets you use real-life examples to change the story you tell\r\nyourself about who you are.\r\n\r\nYou give your brain data that says, \"Bo you are this type of\r\nperson. Remember when you did XYZ even though you were nervous?”\r\n\r\nWhen you stop relying on confidence, you’ll no longer need it.\r\n\r\nBecause no amount of inner work – no amount of money – no fancy\r\nwatch will magically turn you into someone that you’re not right\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nOnly actions can do that.\r\n\r\nLast point to drive this home:\r\n\r\nEvery star basketball player has bad games.\r\n\r\nThere were times when Kobe would go 3/14 throughout a game.\r\n\r\nHe literally holds the NBA record for the worst single-game\r\nshooting percentage when taking 5+ shots.\r\n\r\nYet he still wants the ball in his hands with one minute to go…\r\nno matter how the previous 47 minutes have gone.\r\n\r\nNot because he’s feeling extra confident to step up to the plate\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nBut because in his world, confidence doesn’t exist.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter.\r\n\r\nAnd he doesn’t need it because he replaced it with courage.\r\n\r\nRip Kobe. Makes me sad just thinking about it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I’m not gonna send this email.\r\n\r\nInstead, I’ll write a less personal email that makes me look like\r\na perfect, confident person.\r\n\r\nIf you received this, no, you didn’t.\r\n\r\nMiss her man,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

It always knows.\r\n\r\n- Ben\r\n\r\nP.S. If you’ve noticed I’ve been more consistent with these\r\nemails, you’re right. This is a bit Hubermanesque, but I’ve built\r\na ritual for myself when I want to enter creative mode.

(I\r\ncheated on my main spot).\r\n\r\nOr should I talk about how failures make us who we are because\r\nthey–\r\n\r\nNever mind, you’ve heard enough of that lately.\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\nThe depth in which we know ourselves determines the depth in\r\nwhich we interact with the world.\r\n\r\nLet me say that in English:\r\n\r\nWhen you’re aware of your motives, why you want what you want,\r\nwhy you do what you do – you see with more clarity.\r\n\r\nIt lets you trust yourself more.\r\n\r\nAnd that trust shines through in your relationships.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, my least favorite people are those who lack\r\nself-awareness.\r\n\r\nYou may be reading this right now and thinking it’s ironic that\r\nI’m saying that – but at least I’m aware enough to acknowledge\r\nthat possibility.\r\n\r\nThose who lack self-awareness view themselves as someone they’re\r\nnot, and that creates misalignment in the way reality is viewed.\r\n\r\nThey’re the kind of people that you never see eye to eye with -\r\nno matter how well you explain your perspective on a situation.\r\n\r\nAnd this is created by a lack of introspection.\r\n\r\nSo if there’s anything of value that you take away from this –\r\nfind a way to “talk to yourself” more.\r\n\r\nCould be journaling, walking, driving, or whatever else lets you\r\nfeel like you’re spending quality time with yourself.\r\n\r\nAlriiiighty...\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, this one’s been a struggle for me to write,\r\nso if you’re still here, thanks for sticking with me.\r\n\r\nHopefully, my thoughts will be more coherent tomorrow,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

But without understanding the\r\nterrain, the distances, and the possible roadblocks, you'll\r\nlikely end up lost or going in circles. Along the way, you need\r\nto gather information, learn how to navigate, and understand the\r\ncharacteristics of your vehicle. Similarly, following your\r\npassion without developing relevant skills and acquiring\r\nnecessary knowledge can lead to frustration or even failure.\r\nExperience and understanding of the real-world terrain of your\r\npassion is crucial to reach your desired destination.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hvgq8d3b6 )\r\n| Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hvgq8d3b6 )\r\n| 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hvgq8d3b6/owhkhqhrn7q4moiv/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

Why\r\nare you doing this? Get me out of here. Joe Rogan is a liar. Ok\r\nseriously get out.”\r\n\r\nBut then I take a deep breath and relax.\r\n\r\nI loosen the muscles in my body that are tensing up and tell\r\nmyself it’s really not that bad.\r\n\r\nAnd after a minute or so, the pain goes away.\r\n\r\nOr maybe it doesn’t dissolve – but I learn to tolerate it.\r\n\r\nEither way, it’s an interesting dynamic.\r\n\r\nThere are a few analogies we can pull from this.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious one is “run towards fear. Pleasure is on the\r\nother side of pain, blah blah blah.”\r\n\r\nIt’s a valid point, but I’m not gonna bore you with David\r\nGoggins-themed motivation.\r\n\r\nI think there’s a deeper lesson here that may or may not resonate\r\nwith you…\r\n\r\nWe feel pain when we resist our true selves.\r\n\r\nIt creates an internal conflict where the image that we’re\r\npresenting to the world isn’t congruent with our core belief\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nBecause saying what you want to say and showing others who you\r\nreally are, sounds intimidating.\r\n\r\nIt makes you vulnerable.\r\n\r\nSo you’d rather hide.\r\n\r\nIt’s more comfortable to just paint on a fake smile, fake\r\npersonality, and fake belief system.\r\n\r\nBut after a while, you’ll realize that you’re pretending – and\r\nit’ll start to eat you alive.\r\n\r\nAnd then you’re left with a choice.\r\n\r\nDo you continue to cover up your authenticity with a bigger\r\nshield so that people can’t see in?\r\n\r\nOr do you remove the layers that you’re hiding under and stop\r\nresisting who you really are?\r\n\r\nBecause maybe there’s a chance that it was all just a figment of\r\nyour imagination.\r\n\r\nMaybe raw authenticity won’t actually make you vulnerable.\r\n\r\nMaybe you’ll unlock the desires that you were chasing and\r\ncouldn’t catch.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe you’ll finally find peace with that same voice in your\r\nhead that tells you that the water is too cold.\r\n\r\nOr maybe, I’m just kind of sleepy, and this made no sense.\r\n\r\nReply and let me know what you think :)\r\n\r\nTalk soon,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Other people don’t limit you – they\r\nallow YOU to limit you.\r\n\r\nLet’s say your Mom “makes” your pop tart every morning by putting\r\nit in the toaster and clicking a button.\r\n\r\nYou were never cognizant of how she did it, and now you think you\r\ndon’t know how to heat up a pop tart.\r\n\r\nExtrapolate this to every part of your life, and I think this\r\njumbled-up email will make a bit more sense.\r\n\r\nWhat you’re aware of you’re in control of.

You’re\r\nconstantly thinking about them, and they're going to happen no\r\nmatter what.\r\n\r\nBut you also have a laundry list of the things that you kinda\r\nwant.\r\n\r\nMaybe you kinda want to get jacked, take surfing lessons, learn\r\nguitar, go on more dates, start a YT channel, etc.\r\n\r\nThese unclosed loops become death by 1,000 papercuts.\r\n\r\nThey linger in the back of your head like a gnat that only\r\nbothers you occasionally.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, you’re not thinking about it, but when it’s\r\nbuzzing in your ear, you want nothing more than to kill it.\r\n\r\nAnd in life, you’ll get occasional reminders about your “kinda\r\nwants” to the point where you’ll eventually need to start\r\ntackling them.\r\n\r\nThey could be completely unrelated to your main thing (the things\r\nyou can’t not do) and feel like a pointless side quest.\r\n\r\nBut if they continue to linger, it means there’s something there.\r\n\r\nIt’s an urge you have to quench.\r\n\r\nAll this said, I likely won’t be getting a new TV until September\r\n10th (first day of the Bengals football season).\r\n\r\nDon’t be like me.\r\n\r\nStart attacking one thing that you kinda want today.\r\n\r\n​And follow me on Twitter plz, (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6hdnpo8ralh7/g3hnh5h3nw7dw6ar/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9iZW5oYmFkZXI=\r\n)​\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "I walk past the 9-5ers in Brickell on a sunny Thursday afternoon.\r\n\r\nMost of them are dressed as men's warehouse mannequins. Shirts\r\ntucked in, pants the perfect length, and Apple watches on their\r\nwrists.\r\n\r\nIt’s 90 degrees outside, and they’ve gotta be burning up.\r\n\r\nI can’t help but feel a sliver of guilt as I pass by shirtless –\r\nwearing nothing but kill crew shorts and running shoes.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 22, I have the freedom and am making the money that\r\nthey’re trading 40+ years of their lives for.\r\n\r\nI’m not saying this to sound like a pretentious asshole but\r\nrather to point out the inequity of our inputs.\r\n\r\nThose of us who are in a similar position to me (where life\r\neffectively feels like a video game) are not inherently smarter\r\nthan those trapped at a desk.\r\n\r\nI’d be willing to bet some of those people would smoke us as\r\nentrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nBut the difference is in the way we view the world.\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, we were lucky enough to be delusional.\r\n\r\nSo delusional to the extent that we brainwashed ourselves into\r\nbelieving a different reality was possible.\r\n\r\nAnd this reality rewarded us for our delusion.\r\n\r\nNo matter where you’re at in life, you’re going to reach a\r\nmultitude of intersections where you have to make a decision.\r\n\r\nDo I continue living in my current reality by telling myself the\r\nsame thoughts, ideas, and stories?\r\n\r\nOr do I change the narrative I tell myself and thus adopt\r\ndifferent beliefs that will let me see a new reality?\r\n\r\nThis might sound a bit “woo woo,” so to put it simply:\r\n\r\nThe guy hating everyone in tik tok comments lives in a different\r\nreality than the guy who’s making $10k/month.\r\n\r\nThe guy making $50k/month lives in a different reality than the\r\nguy making $10k/mo.\r\n\r\nAnd the guy making $1m/month lives in a different reality than\r\nany of the above.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate – these realities are simply made up of the stories\r\nwe tell ourselves. To change your situation in life, you must\r\nchange your belief system.\r\n\r\nObserve the ever-present thoughts running through your head.\r\n\r\nDo they make sense?\r\n\r\nDo they serve you?\r\n\r\nDo they align with your goals?\r\n\r\nOR have you just been identifying with them out of habit? They’ve\r\nbeen engrained so deep into your psyche that you don’t even\r\nquestion them.\r\n\r\nContinue to audit your beliefs, continue to discard those which\r\ndon’t serve you, and continue to watch your dreams unfold.\r\n\r\nI must add -- all of this means nothing without taking the\r\naccording actions and developing skills.\r\n\r\nLove you,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "The right answer can only become obvious once a decision has been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nI could end the email here and leave that sentence open to your\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nBut there's almost nothing I love more in this world than to spew\r\nmy thoughts across a computer screen, so here we are.\r\n\r\nYour current situation in life is made up of a series of\r\ndecisions and actions that you’ve chosen (consciously or\r\nunconsciously).\r\n\r\nWhenever you're faced with a tough decision, the answer isn’t\r\nalways obvious on the surface – but it’s only once you make a\r\ndecision the right answer will reveal itself.\r\n\r\nI’m kinda talking in circles right now, so let’s get more\r\npractical…\r\n\r\nAs I look back at the last few years of my life, every big\r\ndecision I made eventually became the “right” decision – but in\r\nthe moment, there were always doubts.\r\n\r\nFrom when I decided not to play college basketball to when I\r\ndropped out of college, those felt like big moves at the time.\r\n\r\nAs I think about them now, it couldn’t be more glaringly obvious\r\nthat those decisions served me.\r\n\r\nBut a lot of people get stuck trying to make a perfect decision,\r\nso they never do anything.\r\n\r\nEven the wrong move will illuminate the right move – as long as\r\nyou’re MOVING.\r\n\r\nThe first real business I started was a marketing agency for\r\nlocal basketball trainers.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t have picked a worse niche, but in hindsight, it’s what\r\nled me to the info-product world, where I’ve been able to find\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nSomeone I know reached an impasse in their career a little bit\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThey had just shut down their previous business and were ready to\r\nstart something new – but trying to figure out what that new\r\nthing was gonna be.\r\n\r\nWe were on the phone one night, tossing around an idea for what\r\nthey could do next.\r\n\r\nAfter some back and forth, they said, “what the hell I’ll try\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThey’re now in a position to make multiple seven, if not eight\r\nfigures with that business and impact thousands of people.\r\n\r\nBut none of this would’ve happened if they didn’t simply decide\r\nand act.\r\n\r\nSo if you’re wondering why I’m telling you this and how it\r\napplies to you – I don’t know.\r\n\r\nI can’t answer that question for you.\r\n\r\nMaybe you’re contemplating a big life move right now, and you’ve\r\nbeen weighing your options for a bit.\r\n\r\nMaybe the weight of the decision is making you anxious and\r\nunhappy.\r\n\r\nMaybe it’s time to make the decision so you can finally figure\r\nout if it was the right or the wrong move.\r\n\r\nAnd eventually, you’ll see that all you needed to do was decide\r\nbecause you’ll end up right where you need to be.\r\n\r\nAs always, reply and let me know if this one resonated.\r\n\r\n​And check out this podcast I did recently with my friend Alex.

    "body": "Finally.\r\n\r\nI’m so back.\r\n\r\nThis is the first ounce of creativity I’ve had in a week.\r\n\r\nFor a bit, I thought I was completely out of ideas, and I’d said\r\nevery word of value that I could.\r\n\r\nBut I was wrong.\r\n\r\nI have plenty to tell you about, and I just wasn’t giving my\r\nthoughts enough of a vessel to transfer into reality (whatever\r\nthe fuck that means).\r\n\r\nAs I was sitting outside Starbucks this morning, it hit me.\r\n\r\nThe only reason people don’t find success in life & business is\r\nbecause they fail to recognize opportunities that are presented\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThey wander through life, perpetually messing up every chance\r\nthey have at making a lot of money.\r\n\r\nAll it takes is one good connection or one win to completely\r\nchange your life.\r\n\r\nThey get a well-respected client who could send them hundreds of\r\nreferrals…\r\n\r\nBuuut they can’t get results, so it falls apart.\r\n\r\nOr they meet someone who can open various doors for them…\r\n\r\nAnd they don’t go above and beyond to add value to that person's\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt’s like they’re either blind to the opportunity or so nervous\r\nto mess it up that they just crumble.\r\n\r\nOne of my first big personal brand clients was a guy named DJ\r\nSakcmann.\r\n\r\nHe’s got about half a million followers on IG and is one of the\r\nmain authorities in the online basketball training space.\r\n\r\nI connected with him through a cold DM on Instagram.\r\n\r\nWe got on a call, and he said needed a new funnel.\r\n\r\nI said, “say no more, fam” and spent the next 4 hours writing\r\nsome of the best copy I’d ever written.\r\n\r\nI built the entire landing page, and by the next morning, he had\r\na new funnel.\r\n\r\nAt the time, I was making around 10k per month, so I obviously\r\ncould charge for my work – but I didn’t ask him for a dime.\r\n\r\nThe funnel I built literally converted 5x better than the one he\r\nhad previously, and it generated hundreds of thousands of\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nFor the next 4 months, I basically worked with him as an unpaid\r\nintern, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made.\r\n\r\nNot only did I eventually get paid a lot of money from DJ, but it\r\nopened so many doors for me.\r\n\r\n* He sent me a handful of referrals\r\n* It gave me confidence that I could get results in the\r\ninfo-product space\r\n* And DJ is now a good friend of mine and one of my most notable\r\ncase studies\r\n\r\nBut it would’ve been so easy to fumble this opportunity.\r\n\r\nI could’ve let my ego get in the way and asked for a lump sum of\r\nmoney upfront.\r\n\r\nI could’ve stopped following up with him when he didn’t reply.\r\n\r\nI could’ve half-assed the funnel and taken much longer to get it\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nBut I recognized the potential upside in this partnership, so I\r\nseized it.\r\n\r\nThis is just one of many examples of the art of craftiness – the\r\nmost overlooked skill in business.\r\n\r\nI’m working with a kid right now named Kevin, who edited a recent\r\npodcast I did (without asking for money).\r\n\r\nNot only am I gonna pay him, but I’ll send him intro’s to\r\npotential clients and give him advice on scaling his business…\r\n\r\nJust because he has enough foresight to go out of his way to\r\nprovide value for me and not be greedy by asking for a bunch of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nOdds are you’ve had chances in your life to help someone who can\r\nopen doors for you.\r\n\r\nIt’s up to you to recognize when those opportunities present\r\nthemselves and go above and beyond to pounce on them.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoyed this email, I’m glad to be back.\r\n\r\n​Check out the podcast I did with Cardinal Mason and Grant Lannin\r\nhere.

I dropped out of school for a reason.\r\n\r\nOkay, I’m stalling now.\r\n\r\nWhat should I write to you about?\r\n\r\nUhhh.\r\n\r\nI’ve been thinking about putting together a course or coaching\r\noffer for a while now.\r\n\r\nI keep going back and forth on what I’d offer, how hands-on it’d\r\nbe, and what people want to learn from me.\r\n\r\nIf I built an agency coaching offer, here’s how I’d position it:\r\n\r\nI’d start by demonizing the traditional SMMA model.\r\n\r\nYou may have heard the saying, “An enemy of my enemy is a friend\r\nof mine.”\r\n\r\nThis common enemy tactic is one of the most powerful tools you\r\ncan use as a marketer.\r\n\r\nYou’re breaking the beliefs of your audience while simultaneously\r\nbuilding a bridge to your solution.\r\n\r\nThis is how I’d sell you on the “full-stack marketer” business\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\nI’d show you how it’s easier to get a few clients to pay you\r\n$5k-$10k+ per month rather than try to stack a bunch of clients\r\non cheap retainers and constantly have to do outreach.\r\n\r\nI’d tell you how I worked with 50+ clients that paid me $1k per\r\nmonth and how much of a headache that was.\r\n\r\nAnd I’d show you how I now get paid $10k- $30k per month (per\r\nclient) without needing a huge team.\r\n\r\nWith enough social proof and personal stories, I’d sell you on\r\nthe business model, and I’d sell you on me.\r\n\r\nNow it’s time to sell you on you.\r\n\r\nThis offer would be for people that have a client or two as a\r\nfreelancer, so I’d speak directly to that archetype.\r\n\r\n“Since you already have some results, this is the easiest way to\r\nscale. You’ll simply be selling more services to someone that\r\nalready trusts you.”\r\n\r\nThis is where I’d use language that shows you how I was once in\r\ntheir shoes and transfer my certainty into their soul (if I can\r\ndo it, you can do it).\r\n\r\nThis is how successful offers are created.\r\n\r\nSell an audience on a mechanism (business model), sell them on\r\nyourself as the authority, and sell them on themselves so they\r\ncan actually visualize their own success.\r\n\r\nHope this gave you a better understanding of how to extract money\r\nfrom strangers on the internet.\r\n\r\nReply if you liked it :)\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Your friends are so lucky to be in your circle.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, I feel the need for every word I say to be insightful.\r\n\r\nWhat if I want to talk about Joe Burrow and Cincinnati Bengals?\r\n\r\nOr my fear of fat people?\r\n\r\nOr how I’m currently seated next to the line to order a coffee,\r\nand some dickhead is standing too close to me?\r\n\r\nIf you couldn’t tell by now, my newsletter is more for me than it\r\nis for you.\r\n\r\nYou’re just an innocent bystander getting hit in the crossfire of\r\nthe combative thoughts in my head.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, and as always lmk if you liked this one Bo.\r\n\r\nHave a great Saturday (if the day of the week means anything to\r\nyou),\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Ugh.\r\n\r\nThere’s a new grey Ford Bronco parked to my left.\r\n\r\nThe new models seem to get hate, but I really like them.\r\n\r\nIf I get a place in LA, maybe I’ll get a 911 and a Bronco…\r\n\r\nStop: 11:47am\r\n\r\nStart again: 10:52pm\r\n\r\nA lot has changed since I left off here.\r\n\r\nI broke my fast a few hours ago, found a mover, and even started\r\nthinking about packing up my belongings.\r\n\r\nOh, and I bought a rose gold olive dial Rolex Presidential today.\r\n\r\nI didn’t mean to, but I finished my work early for the day and\r\nhad nothing else to do other than drive 40 minutes to my boy\r\nJamie and buy a new watch.\r\n\r\nI don’t want you to think I’m flexing (even though I am).\r\n\r\nI’m sharing this with you because I noticed this purchase felt\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nYou know all the things that you envision coming with your\r\n“dream” life? The car, the girl, the house, the status, etc…\r\n\r\nI remember thinking to myself at one point, “Wow, I’ll be so cool\r\nonce I have Rolex – or Audi – or move to Miami.”\r\n\r\nAnd every time I got one of those things, they lost their lust\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nI’d buy them expecting some grand feeling of accomplishment, only\r\nto be let down once the lust wore off.\r\n\r\nBut today, I didn’t feel that.\r\n\r\nI bought the watch because I wanted it – I didn’t expect it to\r\nmake me feel any better about myself or change my perception of\r\nwho I am.\r\n\r\nDropping those illusionary expectations allowed me to find a\r\ndifferent level of appreciation.\r\n\r\nEverything that you own, you’ve earned in one way or another.\r\n\r\nYou have a right to be proud of that.\r\n\r\nBut understand that the things are not you. They are not a place\r\nto source for your own self-worth. And they are not much more\r\nthan a subtle external trophy for winning internal battles.\r\n\r\nFuck I gotta start packing for tomorrow.\r\n\r\nGoodnight,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "I’m sitting at the counter at my lunch spot in Brickell.\r\n\r\nYes, I now call it “my” spot because it basically is.\r\n\r\nSome chubby dork in a red tank top is standing right over my\r\nshoulder waiting for his food, and I’m seconds away from\r\nbackhanding him.\r\n\r\nI hope he’s reading this because he’s close enough to see it.\r\n\r\nI will hit you buddy.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not brand new here and you actually read my emails,\r\nyou’d know I moved a few floors up to a 2-bed apt the other day.\r\n\r\nMoving sucks.\r\n\r\nI swear it’s a less strenuous process for me to make $50k+ on an\r\nhour-long webinar with a client than it is to lug around boxes\r\nand disassemble/reassemble furniture.\r\n\r\nMr. Red Tank Top just left.\r\n\r\nI’m sitting at this counter because I don’t have wifi in my new\r\nspot until 2pm.\r\n\r\nAnd I had to fight tooth and nail even to get it that soon.\r\n\r\nAT&T is the only provider you can use in my building.\r\n\r\nI thought setting up new wifi would be as simple as carrying up\r\nthe box from my old apartment to the new one, but that wasn’t the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nOscar (support agent) told me over the phone that they had to\r\ntransfer and activate the signal to the new unit and then have a\r\n“technician” come out to verify it.\r\n\r\nBut before that could even happen, they needed the lady who lived\r\nin the unit before me to cancel her account to be able to\r\ntransfer the signal.\r\n\r\nI thought that was bullshit, but Oscar implored me that it was\r\nthe quickest solution and that he’d reach out to the previous\r\ntenant and let me know when she answers.\r\n\r\nSo I did what any rational human would do and built an army of\r\nPhillipino (I’m guessing) AT&T agents.\r\n\r\nRight when I got off the phone with Oscar, I called again, got\r\nplaced with a different agent, explained the situation, and asked\r\nthem to reach out to the lady.\r\n\r\nI did this a handful of times until I had 5 or 6 agents literally\r\nharassing this woman.\r\n\r\nFor the next 16 hours… nothing.\r\n\r\nI called again and told them the lady was dead so there was no\r\nway of contacting her, but still they insisted that it was the\r\nonly solution.\r\n\r\nAbout 30 minutes later, John (definitely not his real name), whom\r\nI’d just told that the lady died, called me back.\r\n\r\n“Good news Ben, I got a hold of her and canceled her account.\r\nWe’ll have a technician come out on Thursday, and you’ll be all\r\nsetup.”\r\n\r\nFirst, I told him I loved him for tracking down the lady and\r\nlaughed at how she miraculously must’ve been revived from the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nAnd then I said, “Thursday isn’t gonna happen; what can you do\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nThose nine words saved me 4 days of no wifi.\r\n\r\nJohn (who is now my next of kin in my will) put me on hold for 30\r\nseconds, pulled some Vudu magic, and said, “Ok, your signal will\r\nbe back tomorrow at 2pm. You’ll just need to plug the router into\r\nthe wall.”\r\n\r\nI’m telling you this whole story for a reason.\r\n\r\nThere is always a way to get what you want.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re building a business, trying to get into an\r\nexclusive venue, or want to connect with someone important…\r\n\r\nIf you’re persistent enough, you will find a way.\r\n\r\nEven if it means employing half a dozen Phillipino VAs.\r\n\r\nOr harassing staff to get an omelet at 3am (inside joke - if you\r\nknow, you know).\r\n\r\nGo harass an old lady today,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "I was walking around my house like an idiot 3 minutes ago, trying\r\nto find my computer to write this email.\r\n\r\nIt was hidden in plain sight, but I didn’t know where to look\r\nbecause it wasn’t in any of the usual spots.\r\n\r\nLesson in there.\r\n\r\nOn my walk back from soybucks this morning, I was trying to make\r\na TikTok about how money means everything and nothing at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe video sucked because it’s easier for me to work out concepts\r\nlike this in writing first, so let’s do it together, shall we?\r\n\r\nMoney gives you the autonomy to be who you really are.\r\n\r\nMy friend Mason has said something like this before.\r\n\r\nThe peace of mind in knowing you’re good financially allows you\r\ntime to “side quest.”\r\n\r\nAnd in these side quests, you’re gonna learn more about yourself\r\nand the world than you would if your only pursuit is money.\r\n\r\nI neglected this for a while, but it’s how you start to live in a\r\nway that genuinely aligns with your soul.\r\n\r\nAnd when you do that, you become magnetic.\r\n\r\nThis sounds woo-woo, but it’s true-true. Ok pretend I didn’t say\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nYou can see this in people's eyes – It’s a glimpse into their\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nThe eyes chico, they never lie.\r\n\r\nIt’s why you get a weird feeling about someone when you meet\r\nthem, but you can’t explain it, so you just say something's “off”\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nIt’s why you know she’s a good girl at heart even though she’s at\r\nthe club every night (miss her).\r\n\r\nAnd it’s why you naturally gravitate towards some people more\r\nthan others.\r\n\r\nThey’re either truly themselves, and it makes you want to be\r\naround them more, or they’re pretending, and you can feel it on a\r\nsubconscious level.\r\n\r\nHere’s a litmus test for you: How many things do you do just\r\nbecause you want to?\r\n\r\nThere’s no real angle or motive; it just feels like something you\r\nwere called towards.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I make content.

You run your life… you’re not on\r\nautopilot.\r\n\r\nDo this enough, and maybe you’ll be so enlightened that you end\r\nup disheveled, sitting outside of Starbucks, talking to the voice\r\nin your head…\r\n\r\nOr maybe you end up becoming exactly who you were meant to be.\r\n\r\nMissed you, Bo.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re new here, welcome.

    "body": "I’m convinced everyone has anxiety and/or depression.\r\n\r\nIt’s just a matter of what degree they listen to it.\r\n\r\nKeep telling yourself bad things, and you will literally program\r\nyourself to always think that way.\r\n\r\nThose constant negative thoughts end up shaping your entire\r\nidentity and perception of yourself.\r\n\r\nOnce a belief is accepted as an unchangeable fact, our\r\nmalleability gets diminished.\r\n\r\n“I am an anxious person” or “I am a depressed person” gets\r\nrepeated until it’s deeply embedded into someone's psyche.\r\n\r\nAnd on a long enough time horizon, that person forgets that there\r\nwas ever another option.\r\n\r\nAn option where they didn't have to give power to their negative\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nOr where they understood they could decide who they are.\r\n\r\nAnd as long as they don’t suppress their true desires, that evil\r\nvoice gets a little bit quieter.\r\n\r\nI don’t think it ever goes away – it just takes a backseat.\r\n\r\nEven when you’re living your “dream life,” sometimes you’ll wake\r\nup on the wrong side of the bed.\r\n\r\nYou’ll never be completely immune to occasional highs and lows.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, you’ll question everything about your life\r\njust hours after thinking you’re invincible.\r\n\r\nThat fluctuation is inevitable. It’s natural.\r\n\r\nAnd accepting it is part of the solution.\r\n\r\nIt can be as simple as shifting from “I feel like shit right now,\r\nand I hate this” to “I feel like shit right now, and that’s\r\nokay.”\r\n\r\nOf course, there are times when a negative situation shouldn’t be\r\naccepted and instead used as fuel for change.\r\n\r\nBut I’m talking about the other times where you just seem to hit\r\na wall for no rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nThat happens to me all the time. The same goes for almost all of\r\nmy friends, so I imagine it happens to you.\r\n\r\nThe secret is discerning when a feeling needs to be accepted and\r\nwhen it needs to inspire change.\r\n\r\nBefore dropping out of college a few years ago, sometimes I’d\r\nquietly get anxious.\r\n\r\nAlthough my life looked fun on the surface, I could simply feel\r\nthat path wasn’t right for me (emphasis on feel, not think).\r\n\r\nThere was objectively no fulfillment.\r\n\r\nI went out all the time and “celebrated” although I had nothing\r\nto celebrate – it was an escape from a life with a lack of\r\npurpose, ambition, or improvement.\r\n\r\nIf I didn’t change, it would’ve eaten me alive.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I’m now in a position that I was enamored by for\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn’t stop me from occasionally questioning if I’m an\r\nabsolute idiot and if I should move across the country to live on\r\na farm with Amish people and cows.\r\n\r\nOdds are that’s just a natural low – in fact, I know it is\r\nbecause it feels different.\r\n\r\nSo when those types of thoughts come up, I try not to give them\r\npower. I accept them as they are – the devil who will always be\r\nthere on my shoulder.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s okay.\r\n\r\nHope this all made sense. Let me know if you made it down here.\r\n\r\nHave a good day,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkor9vouvhpvkxwrr\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkor9vouvhpvkxwrr\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkor9vouvhpvkxwrr/e0hph7h02qpvg8t8/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

I’ve been putting off making this\r\n4-minute phone call for 3 weeks now.\r\n\r\nI’ll probably continue to procrastinate until I wake up one day\r\nand can’t turn on the faucet to brush my teeth.\r\n\r\nToday is my first full day being 23 years old.\r\n\r\nBirthdays are interesting because they are meaningless unless you\r\ngive them meaning.\r\n\r\nIt’s not like you instantly reach a new level of wisdom or get\r\nyour first grey hair the day after you hit a new number.\r\n\r\nThe only difference is the perception.\r\n\r\nIf a 29-year-old degenerate wakes up on his 30th birthday and\r\ndecides that he’s now too old to smoke weed all day and throw\r\ntogether 19 leg parlays in hopes that $6 will turn into $800, and\r\nhe changes his actions accordingly; then the arbitrary number now\r\nhas meaning.\r\n\r\nI’m feeling this right now, too.\r\n\r\nThe perceived gap between 22 and 23 is rather large in my head.\r\n\r\nAt 22, the bar’s pretty low – simply having my own apartment, a\r\nnice car, and smelling nice seemed to be impressive.\r\n\r\nAt 23, I feel more pressure.\r\n\r\n$500k-$1m annually is cute.

    "body": "I often make fun of the dudes who constantly preach gratitude.\r\n\r\nIt can sound ingenuine as if they’re talking about how grateful\r\nor how “at peace” they are as a way to make themselves feel\r\nbetter than others, which couldn’t be more hypocritical.\r\n\r\nIt’s similar to those who use their belief and connection to God\r\nas a way to prop up their ego.\r\n\r\nBut there comes a time when gratitude stares you back in the face\r\nas the only answer.\r\n\r\nYou’ll go and get everything you previously dreamt of, and it\r\nwon’t feel the way you anticipated.\r\n\r\nHow many times can you go through this process until you realize\r\nthat you’re chasing your own tail?\r\n\r\nConsidering this is a topic I’ve written about frequently, the\r\nanswer to the question above is obvious.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, you will always want more.\r\n\r\nThere’s always gonna be another mountain to climb, hoops to jump\r\nthrough, and levels to ascend to.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s okay – as long as you accept it.\r\n\r\nAcceptance is another thing that’s been on my mind recently.\r\n\r\nEverything you do is a choice that you make.\r\n\r\nWhere you are right now, your habits, and your beliefs about\r\nyourself are all decisions that can be traced back to no one but\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nUnease comes from the lies that you tell yourself about your\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nYou say you want to change, but your actions do not correlate\r\nwith change.\r\n\r\nWhen your actions fail to follow suit with the things you claim\r\nto want, it creates a disconnect between your actual reality and\r\nyour desired reality.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s where unhappiness stems from.\r\n\r\nPause for a second and audit your current situation in life.\r\n\r\nConsider your goals, routine, and beliefs.\r\n\r\nWould the previous version of you from a year, 2 years, or 5\r\nyears ago be ecstatic?\r\n\r\nGood. You have a lot to be grateful for.\r\n\r\nBut it’s also likely that you’re currently holding some desires\r\nthat are causing you anxiety because your actions do not align\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nIt’s okay that you want more – just ensure that you’re taking the\r\nnecessary action to fulfill those desires.\r\n\r\nEnough rambling for today.\r\n\r\nHope this was semi-coherent,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hdxo8e7brh5p9wv99\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hdxo8e7brh5p9wv99\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hdxo8e7brh5p9wv99/g3hnh5h3z64mgrir/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "I’ve spent the last 45 minutes contemplating the best route to\r\nmore money and more freedom.\r\n\r\nThe past couple of weeks have been busy, and I haven’t had a\r\nchance to spend much quality time alone.\r\n\r\nI define quality time alone as the uninterrupted moments between\r\nyou and the 37 voices in your head.\r\n\r\nThese are the opportunities that allow you to think critically\r\nand perform a mini audit on your life.\r\n\r\nI could write a whole email on the importance of prioritizing\r\nthis and how most people are too sTuCk iN tHe MaTriX to ever\r\nfigure out what they actually want.\r\n\r\nBut I’ll spare you today.\r\n\r\nI went on a long walk this morning and let my mind wander.\r\n\r\nAfter my walk, I sat down outside Starbucks with a cold brew, and\r\nnow I’m here writing to you.\r\n\r\nSometimes, just the act of thinking about your “problems” will\r\ndrastically improve your mental state because you realize how\r\nsilly they are.\r\n\r\nThere are people dying, and I’m over here stressing about how I\r\nneed multi 8 figures by age 30.\r\n\r\n99.9% of the world would trade everything for my “problems.”\r\n\r\nI could go on about this, but there are already enough people who\r\ntalk about gratitude on the internet.\r\n\r\nWhile I was walking, I was thinking about a friend of mine who\r\nrecently ended up in a sticky situation.\r\n\r\nHis 7 figure business fell apart nearly overnight, and a series\r\nof unfortunate events drastically depleted his bank account.\r\n\r\nScary right?\r\n\r\nThere’s a level of freedom you reach when everything goes to shit\r\nlike this — and it gives rewards the equal (or even greater)\r\nopportunity if you can get through it.\r\n\r\nMy friend started a new business and has been on an absolute tear\r\nfor the last handful of months.\r\n\r\nHe’s working nonstop but just seems to be electric about the work\r\nand thinks that this new business could make him 8 figures over\r\nthe next few years.\r\n\r\nI’ve been envious of the excitement he has for this new project\r\nand asked him if he ever has days where he doesn’t want to work.\r\n\r\nI’m paraphrasing, but basically he said, “Sure, there are, but I\r\ndon’t give much power to it. The work just feels like something\r\nthat has to be done.”\r\n\r\nHis answer makes perfect sense to me.\r\n\r\nHe’s not passionate about the day-to-day tasks. He’s not immune\r\nto the monotony that comes with building a business.\r\n\r\nBut the end goal and the vision are big enough that they carry\r\nhim through the tediousness (plus the situation with his previous\r\nbusiness adds some urgency).\r\n\r\nMy main takeaway here is this:\r\n\r\nIf the work always feels like a herculean task, you’re playing\r\ntoo small.\r\n\r\nWhen you truly believe that what you’re building has the\r\npotential to be special, that passion puts you on autopilot and\r\ncarries you through the boring stuff.\r\n\r\nTake a walk today and think about where you want to be in 5\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nClearly envision it – money, lifestyle, relationships, impact.\r\n\r\nDo your current daily actions align with that goal?\r\n\r\nIf not, now you know where to start.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoyed this one.\r\n\r\nMuch love,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. Start paying more attention to the things that come\r\nnaturally to you.\r\n\r\nWrite down a list of the things you enjoy doing the most, and do\r\nnot neglect them.\r\n\r\nP.P.S. I am not a self-improvement guru or life coach. My goal is\r\nsimply to share my perspective through the lens in which I view\r\nthe world. Nearly nothing I tell you is a universal truth.\r\n\r\nLet me know if my perspective resonates :)\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403seh5kmvkdsxh3q7kv77\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403seh5kmvkdsxh3q7kv77\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403seh5kmvkdsxh3q7kv77/08hwh9hd7rnm54ul/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

I’m not\r\nusually one to be anxious socially – It was just a lot of “new”\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nNew city.\r\n\r\nNew friends.\r\n\r\nNew routine.\r\n\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nI immediately had a solid group of friends who I’d met through\r\nsocial media, but none of us were really “plugged in” here.\r\n\r\nAnd because all of the newness was intimidating to me, I kind of\r\njust latched on to the friend group.\r\n\r\nI never took the lead or planned anything – I would just go with\r\nthe flow.\r\n\r\nThen, after a few month period where I was almost never going\r\nout, I realized that I wasn’t living the fun “Miami lifestyle” I\r\nenvisioned.\r\n\r\nI also started to really despise working.\r\n\r\nA $50k month vs a $100k month virtually had no difference to me,\r\nso I lost almost all motivation to keep pushing for new numbers.\r\n\r\nSo I took back control and started doing my own thing.\r\n\r\nI hired a boxing coach, went out to new clubs and restaurants,\r\nand started meeting new people.\r\n\r\nI learned to lean more into my uniqueness and have become more of\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I’ve created the exact lifestyle that would play as a\r\nmovie scene in my head when I pictured moving to Miami a year and\r\na half ago.\r\n\r\nI’m sharing all this with you to encourage you to do more.\r\n\r\n-- You can grow your business while living the social life you\r\nwant, trying new hobbies, and keeping up with all of your 16\r\nwives.\r\n\r\n-- You feel most alive when you get rid of the scapegoats you may\r\nblame for why you’re not as happy as you want to be. Take control\r\nof your habits, routines, and decisions.\r\n\r\n-- It’s okay to do things for the “sake of it.” You have an\r\ninclination to do those things for a reason.\r\n\r\n-- Do not settle when it comes to your true desires. Most get a\r\ntenth of the way there and justify settling for “good enough”\r\nalong the way. Fuck that. We want Lambos and Pateks. Not a Model\r\n3’s and Apple Watches.\r\n\r\nAlrighty.\r\n\r\nOriginally, this email was gonna be about my new lock screen on\r\nmy phone, but I got caught in the zone and felt like this\r\ndeserved the spotlight.\r\n\r\nMaybe I’ll write to you about the new one tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHope you liked it – let me know if you made it all the way down\r\nhere\r\n\r\nDo more,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/wvunperxzdhgh586w37u7heredkxx\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/wvunperxzdhgh586w37u7heredkxx\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/wvunperxzdhgh586w37u7heredkxx/vqh3hrhpn28qr0ag/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

But if you can simply bring yourself to do your\r\nbest in that given moment, you’ll keep moving forward.\r\n\r\nDoing your best also applies to your interactions with others.\r\n\r\nInstead of worrying about what to say to impress someone or the\r\nperfect lines to make a girl fall in love with you – approach\r\ninteractions with the goal of simply spreading good energy (corny\r\nagain, but true).\r\n\r\nThis approach takes all of the pressure away, and It gives you\r\ncontrol of any situation.\r\n\r\nSwitching gears - sometimes, I’ll run into moments like this when\r\nI’m writing, and I feel like I’ve completed the entire argument\r\nfor the point I’m trying to make.\r\n\r\nHow many more times can I tell you to do your best?\r\n\r\nI actually got this “do your best” concept from the book The Four\r\nAgreements, and it stuck with me for a few days, so that’s when I\r\ndecided to make it my phone background.\r\n\r\nI’m not gonna keep hammering this into your head – But just start\r\nto take note of your goals in different situations.\r\n\r\n“Am I anxious when talking to this person because I’m trying to\r\nget something out of them or impress them?”\r\n\r\n“Am I tired of doing the same monotonous work, so I procrastinate\r\nuntil the last second and then half-ass it, which makes me\r\nanxious because I know I could’ve done better?”\r\n\r\nIn those situations, changing the goal is the solution.\r\n\r\nIf you go into the interaction aiming to do your best to say what\r\nyou want to say, or if you approach your work with the goal of\r\ndoing what you need to in the most effective manner possible…\r\n\r\nThe anxiety goes away.\r\n\r\nYou feel your best when you do your best.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for reading\r\n\r\nIf you reply and tell me you love me, maybe I’ll even write\r\nanother email tomorrow.\r\n\r\nMuch love,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u0kgn5wzhvh8e0l52i6h7n74kgg\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u0kgn5wzhvh8e0l52i6h7n74kgg\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u0kgn5wzhvh8e0l52i6h7n74kgg/3ohphkh7qoqr0mfr/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

No.\r\n\r\nBut recognizing the freedom and the options that we have will\r\nhelp us understand this:\r\n\r\nEverything that is going on in your life right now is a result of\r\ndecisions you have made.\r\n\r\nYou choose the stress you allow into your life; you choose the\r\npeople, the goals, and the perception of reality that you make.\r\n\r\nYou choose whether or not you want to have difficult\r\nconversations with a friend, and you choose whether or not you\r\ntell yourself that you’re too hungover to go on your Sunday\r\nmorning run.\r\n\r\nYou choose how much of yourself you express when you’re around\r\ndifferent types of people, and you choose the way you react when\r\nthings don’t go as planned.\r\n\r\nYou choose to hold yourself to a certain standard and to do or\r\nnot do things that you commit to.\r\n\r\nNow, I say all this to show you that if you are unhappy, if you\r\nare anxious, or if you feel like you’re not living in alignment\r\nwith the life you’re meant to live – it’s on you.\r\n\r\nYou’re actively deciding to live the exact life that you’re\r\nliving right now, and any conflict comes from failing to accept\r\nthat decision as your own.\r\n\r\nYou have more freedom than you’re telling yourself, but you’re\r\nmaking shitty rules that keep you stuck.\r\n\r\nObviously, without any rules, chaos would ensue – just make sure\r\nthe ones you abide by are actually serving you.\r\n\r\nHappy Sunday and go Bengals,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/p9urk7dqlxh9h380lpguqhmomq933\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/p9urk7dqlxh9h380lpguqhmomq933\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/p9urk7dqlxh9h380lpguqhmomq933/l2hehmh3on0g39i6/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "Happy Monday Bo,\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to forget that you are in control of your state.\r\n\r\nYes, you will have bad days, you’ll go through ruts, and there\r\nare some circumstances outside of your control.\r\n\r\nBut half the battle is in just showing up for yourself and doing\r\nwhat you know needs to be done.\r\n\r\nYet sometimes, even though you know this to be true, you still\r\nmanage to neglect the things that will make you feel fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFor me, I know that when I do the following, I feel better than\r\nwhen I don’t:\r\n\r\n* Long-form writing (this can be tweeting, journaling, these\r\nemails, or all of the 3)\r\n* Knocking out my to-do list and staying on top of everything in\r\nmy business\r\n* Making video content\r\n* Walking outside & spending time in the sun\r\n* Going to the gym\r\n\r\nI’m sure there are others that I’m missing, but these are the\r\ncore 5 that come to mind.\r\n\r\nIt’s irresponsible to underestimate the power that little habits\r\nlike this can have in our lives (speaking from experience, as\r\nyou’ve seen some inconsistency in these emails lol).\r\n\r\nMy friend Miles is one of the most dialed people I know when it\r\ncomes to his routine.\r\n\r\nAnd it just so happens that he never seems to be down.\r\n\r\nHe knows the handful of things that have to be done every day for\r\nhim to keep moving the needle forward, and he doesn’t miss a day.\r\n\r\nMake a list of your non-negotiables and do them every day.\r\n\r\nI kind of sound like the corny self-improvement personal brand\r\nguy that I make fun of.\r\n\r\nMaybe they have a point?\r\n\r\nMoving on – success is inevitable when you pull the one big\r\nlever.\r\n\r\nI turn away most of the prospects that come to us because they\r\nsimply don’t have enough traffic.\r\n\r\nThey’re trying to optimize all the backend systems and their\r\noffer – but even if those two things are the best in the world,\r\nit won’t matter because no one is seeing it.\r\n\r\nIf you have a ton of traffic, you can do everything wrong and\r\nstill make money – that’s when you know you’ve found something.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in dating, when a girl truly likes you, you can break\r\nall the red-pill rules of “game,” and it’ll probably make her\r\nlike you more.\r\n\r\nYou can be goofy, and you don’t have to try hard to have “frame\r\ncontrol” because you are the frame – You’ve developed into\r\nsomeone worthy of respect and admiration, so simply leaning more\r\ninto your nature and showing your personality will make that\r\nperson like you more.\r\n\r\nLast thing that’s been on my mind that I’ll attempt to\r\narticulate:\r\n\r\nPlaying in the different arenas of life will expose you to the\r\nfact that you need a true mission.\r\n\r\nYou need to conquer your inclinations to side quest and quench\r\nthose thirsts.\r\n\r\nThese can be new hobbies, traveling, dating, etc.\r\n\r\nOnly once you pursue them will you know that you cannot find\r\nfulfillment in them – and that’s a good thing.\r\n\r\nYou’ll be able to enjoy these pleasures as they are and return to\r\nyour main goal with more firepower.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this last point is making sense for you, but it’s one\r\nof the biggest things I’ve learned recently – let me know if it\r\nresonates at all.\r\n\r\nI know this one was long and scattered, but hopefully, you\r\nenjoyed this somewhat rapid-fire style today.\r\n\r\nLet’s have a great week,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hdx5vgeirh5p5o699\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hdx5vgeirh5p5o699\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hdx5vgeirh5p5o699/48hvhehr099vnksx/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

It makes me wonder how they operate on\r\ntheir own and if they just go throughout their day without water.\r\n\r\n2: We are hard-wired to be obsessed.\r\n\r\nIf you’re smart, you get obsessed with something that brings you\r\nfulfillment and makes you money.\r\n\r\nYour purpose is to find the things that are worth obsessing over\r\nfor you and carry them out to their fullest potential.\r\n\r\nThis is where you find the flow state.\r\n\r\n3: I’m (probably) not smarter than you.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I see people comment on my videos or reply to my\r\nemails saying things like, “How are you so wise for being this\r\nyoung?”\r\n\r\nThe answer is that I trust myself. I’ve developed enough\r\nconviction in my own perception of the human experience that\r\nseems to resonate with others. You, too, have the same wisdom if\r\nyou care enough to listen to it.\r\n\r\n4: Being intentional and setting goals put your subconscious to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAlmost every time I put “make 2 tik toks” or “write 3 tweets” on\r\nmy to-do list for the day, my brain starts feeding me ideas.\r\n\r\nThis applies to any goal or desire in life.\r\n\r\n5: When you utilize money to its maximum ability, you reach a new\r\nlevel of autonomy.\r\n\r\nI buy $300 massages a few times per month (no happy ending). I\r\ndidn’t realize this was “expensive” for a massage until the way a\r\nfriend of mine reacted when I told them.\r\n\r\nIt made me think about other little things like this that make me\r\nappreciate money – fancy dinners, clothes, sporting events, paid\r\nparking, and subscriptions, are all effectively free.\r\n\r\n6: I’m going to bed.\r\n\r\nI’m not gonna proofread this, so if it was illegible or I spoke\r\nabout my disdain for fat people - I’m sorry.\r\n\r\nHope this was half-decent.

Complacency. Living the same day for 50\r\nyears. Losing the spark with a girl and staying in the\r\nrelationship only because finding someone else would be too hard.\r\nOr when the most exciting part of the day is hitting the green\r\nlight at the busy intersection on the way home from work.\r\n\r\nDoes the spark inevitably fail after a while or is that a lie\r\nthat’s been perpetuated by these doom and gloom water cooler\r\nconversation and “wait till you’re 40” types?\r\n\r\nOr are they actually the enlightened ones because they’re able to\r\nseem outwardly content with the “simple life” and I just don’t\r\nhave enough appreciation for the little things?\r\n\r\nMaybe. These are questions I don’t have the answers to.\r\n\r\nFor now, I’m gonna go get the same tacos I eat every day for\r\nlunch, hop on the usual 3 pm meeting, hit the gym, and call it a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nOoh, it’s chest day. If it’s not too crowded and I can get a\r\nbench that’ll be the highlight of my day!\r\n\r\nSome good basketball on tonight too.\r\n\r\nWill circle back tomorrow!\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

I bet she wouldn’t get mad at\r\nme for leaving the toilet seat up the same way my girl does.”\r\n\r\nAnd here comes the poison.\r\n\r\nYou start observing your girl in a different light.\r\n\r\nThe things you loved about her begin losing their luster.\r\n\r\nYou think more and more about what she does wrong and what you\r\ndon’t like about her.\r\n\r\nOver time, your relationship is silently in shambles. Neither of\r\nyou have acknowledged it yet, but you’ve been fighting way more\r\nabout little things.\r\n\r\nYou’re no longer the person she fell in love with, and you’ve\r\nwarped your perception of her to the point where you think she’s\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\nEventually, it all goes up in flames, and you find your way to\r\ngirl number 2.\r\n\r\nExcept she’s not just number 2.\r\n\r\nYou’ve ben doing this countless times with nearly everything in\r\nyour life.\r\n\r\nYou get what you want, and stop watering your own grass.\r\n\r\nYou slowly poison it, evade to the next one, and start all over.\r\n\r\nThis is a vicious cycle – Water your own grass and be careful of\r\nthese thoughts that there is always something better.\r\n\r\nThey will sprout quickly, and soon enough, you’ll live in a\r\nforest full of poison.\r\n\r\nAvoid looking for problems where there are none – because you\r\nwill find what you seek.\r\n\r\nThe grass is always (and never) greener when you fail to water\r\nyour own,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. I had fun with this one. My creativity is way better here\r\nthan it is in Miami. I think I’d like it here better, for sure.\r\nAfter all, the constant reggaeton in Miami gets annoying. And\r\neverythings so congested! Hmmm.\r\n\r\nP.P.S. ^ that is sarcasm to illustrate my point if you’re slow\r\nand didn’t catch it.\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkxl7ndsvhpnpe8rr\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkxl7ndsvhpnpe8rr\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkxl7ndsvhpnpe8rr/9qhzhnhpgw39g0i9/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "You cannot “find” your passion. Get to work, and your passion\r\nwill find you.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started playing basketball as a kid, I had no idea\r\nthat it would consume the following decade of my life.\r\n\r\nI figured, “What the hell?” I’ll try this thing out and see if I\r\nlike it.\r\n\r\nA few years later, I was still lukewarm – I enjoyed the sport and\r\nwas decent for my age, but it wasn’t too serious.\r\n\r\nThen I started working with a trainer who played in college.\r\n\r\nI still remember walking into the gym in my first session with\r\nhim and seeing orange cones sprawled across the hardwood.\r\n\r\nAnd the following workout changed the course of my entire life.\r\n\r\nIt was the most challenging 1.5-hour session I’d ever done – and\r\nin those moments, I fell in love with the pursuit of mastery.\r\n\r\nFor the next 7+ years, this pursuit of mastery became my life.\r\n\r\nI cherished the times when I’d walk into an empty gym.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the ball hitting the court was like music to me.\r\n\r\nI felt completely present, and that’s when I knew I was alive.\r\n\r\nThe thing about this feeling is it can never leave you.\r\n\r\nIt’s almost like you can’t unsee it once you see it.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever been obsessed with something and have spent every\r\nwaking hour at your disposal consumed by said thing, you can\r\nnever go back.\r\n\r\nIf and when that thing ends, that fire is still in you, and it\r\nmust be transmuted into something else, or it will burn you\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nBut let’s rewind real quick.\r\n\r\nI got so distracted by the power of obsession that I forgot why I\r\nstarted this email.\r\n\r\nIt’s no secret that life without purpose is a bland life.\r\n\r\nEveryone wants to “find their passion,” but few seem to do so.\r\n\r\nThe problem is people assume that this intensity towards a\r\ncalling is just gonna slap them in the face one day.\r\n\r\nThey’ll just be frolicking through the dairy aisle and get hit\r\nwith a carton of milk that says, “Dedicate your life to XYZ.”\r\n\r\nNot how it works.\r\n\r\nYou have to go out there and hunt. And after hunting for a while,\r\nmaybe you’ll find your prey.\r\n\r\nBut if you don’t, that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It simply\r\nmeans you aren’t opening enough doors.\r\n\r\nYou’re not giving luck enough of a chance.\r\n\r\nSo you keep hunting and building until you realize that you’ve\r\nfound exactly what you’re looking for.\r\n\r\nAnd when you stop and pause, you’ll see that passion actually did\r\nslap you in the face. It was already inside of you, and you just\r\nhad to let it out.\r\n\r\nHappy Monday Bo,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkxw33eavhpnpe8rr\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkxw33eavhpnpe8rr\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkxw33eavhpnpe8rr/owhkhqhr42zg90fv/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "People-watching is so fun sometimes\r\n\r\nThere’s this one dorky, curly-haired kid sitting to my right\r\n\r\nI always see him outside of Starbucks, and he makes me grateful\r\nfor the type of business I run.\r\n\r\nI overheard him on a sales call one day, and it was apparent he\r\nruns the same kind of lead gen agency I used to run in the\r\nbasketball space, but he’s in a boring financial niche.\r\n\r\nA tall man in work clothes just walked by while holding a book up\r\nto his face and reading.\r\n\r\nCould you do that? I certainly couldn’t.\r\n\r\nAnd then this Asian girl walked out of Starbucks really quickly\r\nand really… hard.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure how else to explain her strut.\r\n\r\nIt was like she was exerting all of her force into each step and\r\nswaying aggressively from side to side.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the way you’d see the nerdy, overly excited, yet timid\r\ngirls walk in school.\r\n\r\nI didn’t even mention the homeless man to my left, who’s been\r\nmurmuring random sentences for the last few minutes, but let’s\r\nmove on.\r\n\r\nOften times when I don’t have an immediate idea to write about,\r\nI’ll start the email the way I did above.\r\n\r\nJust a bunch of random little observations of my surroundings.\r\n\r\nMaybe that’s a lesson.\r\n\r\nI feel much more present now than I did a few minutes ago.\r\n\r\nI also think it helps put me in a different state where I no\r\nlonger approach this blank page with the thought of “I need to\r\nthink of something to write about.”\r\n\r\nBut rather, I just start writing, and whatever comes to mind goes\r\non the page.\r\n\r\nLet’s extrapolate these two things to life:\r\n\r\nYou know how all guided meditations start with presence?\r\n\r\n“Focus on your breathing, feel the seat beneath you, place your\r\nattention on your chest, etc.”\r\n\r\nIt serves as a reminder that you are here — where unless you’re\r\nin some immediate danger or physical pain, nothing is wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd when you’re fully present this way, that’s when you’re at\r\nyour best.\r\n\r\nOk, quick detour, the homeless guy to my left is starting to get\r\ninto an aggressive argument with someone in his head and growing\r\nincreasingly loud.\r\n\r\nIf he mistakes me for the person in his head, I’m ready to throw\r\nhands with this guy.\r\n\r\nHe just got up and scurried away.\r\n\r\nIt’s interesting because I’ve seen this guy in particular a lot\r\nand sometimes he’s been semi-normal.\r\n\r\nI heard him having a conversation about the Ohio State and\r\nMichigan football rivalry, and it sounded perfectly sane.\r\n\r\nI guess that’s schizophrenia for ya.\r\n\r\nI’m sidetracked now and forget what I was gonna say before that\r\ndetour. Ironic for an email about presence.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the last thing I’ll share with ya...\r\n\r\nMy agency has consistently been over $100k a month for a few\r\nmonths now while working with just 6-9 clients at a time.\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n\r\n* Rev shares are how you make real money with an agency\r\n* Getting clients through inbound and referrals is far superior\r\nto cold outreach.\r\n* Do not be afraid to sacrifice some margin and delegate — this\r\nhas been a big one for me as I started to feel burnt out with\r\nclient work.\r\n* Learning direct response copy is the first fundamental skill\r\nyou need. Over time you can add complementary skills that make\r\nyou more valuable to businesses.\r\n\r\nAlrighty, that’s all for today.\r\n\r\nIf you have any specific questions - whether it’s about business\r\nor anything else I ramble about here, reply and lmk\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh2kwp68c2hx2x0m66\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh2kwp68c2hx2x0m66\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh2kwp68c2hx2x0m66/m2h7h5h8ox7gonfm/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "Let’s talk about business.\r\n\r\nIf you have zero clue what I do and how it works, here’s a brief\r\nTLDR:\r\n\r\nI run a marketing agency where I work with many of the big\r\npersonal brands that you see online with hundreds of thousands of\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nOver the last few months, we’ve consistently been over $100k per\r\nmonth with minimal expenses.\r\n\r\nI have a team of 3 people, and we work with around 7-10 clients\r\nat a time.\r\n\r\nThe majority of clients we work with are making anywhere from\r\n$100k- $600k per month selling info-products and coaching\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\nMost of the revenue we bring in as an agency comes from our\r\n10-20% performance fees on the revenue we generate.\r\n\r\nOur bread and butter as an agency are webinars and new product\r\nlaunches.\r\n\r\nWe provide full-stack services to our clients, meaning we build\r\ntheir funnels, script VSLs, script and build slides for webinars,\r\nrun email marketing, and provide a few other services, including\r\ngeneral consulting.\r\n\r\nAll of our clients come to us through referrals and my Twitter\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nMake sense so far?\r\n\r\nHere’s how I ended up here:\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I started a different agency working with\r\nbasketball trainers.\r\n\r\nI was able to work with many of the trainers you may see on\r\nsocial media that had big audiences, and in that process, I got\r\nreally good at one thing:\r\n\r\nGetting people to take action through the written word, otherwise\r\nknown as copywriting.\r\n\r\nI also accumulated a handful of other skills that I use with the\r\nclients we work with, including funnel building, backend system\r\nsetup, and a deep understanding of info-product businesses as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nI don’t know how this all may relate to you, but perhaps you’re\r\nan agency owner or freelancer who wants to make more money with\r\nfewer clients.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the biggest things I’ve learned in going from\r\n$25k/mo - $100k/mo+ over the past year:\r\n\r\n* The real money is in revenue shares. To be able to get rev\r\nshares where clients pay you $20k+ without batting an eye, you\r\nmust become irreplaceable in their business. This is where the\r\nmultitude of services we offer (and do better than 99% of other\r\nagencies) comes in handy.\r\n* You need a team, but hiring doesn’t have to be difficult. I’m a\r\nhorrible operator, and I didn’t want to have to babysit new team\r\nmembers I brought on. So, my team consists of 2 of my closest who\r\nwere already very skilled in the work we do. And although I\r\nsacrifice some margin, it saves me so much time and headache that\r\nI would have if I tried to do everything on my own.\r\n* Client results & personal brand is the best form of outreach.\r\nTwo months ago, I closed a new client who found me through\r\nTwitter and knew some of the people we work with. He’s paid us\r\nover $50k, mostly from our performance fees. I have opportunities\r\nlike this come up frequently because of the two assets I\r\nmentioned above (client results & personal brand).\r\n* Do not be afraid to cut ties with clients when things are not\r\ngoing the way you need them to. I am selective with who I bring\r\non, and I’ve learned that short-term cash is never worth the\r\nheadache when I see red flags. I turn away most of the prospects\r\nthat book calls with me if they don’t fit the criteria that I\r\nknow we need to succeed.\r\n\r\nIf you’re working in a similar type of business, I hope this\r\nhelps. Feel free to reply and fire away with any questions.\r\n\r\nLet get richer,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hv3786gc6hrzom444\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hv3786gc6hrzom444\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hv3786gc6hrzom444/owhkhqhr4z6dwnfv/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

It sucks. And change is hard.\r\n\r\nBut once you start, inertia starts to build.\r\n\r\nEven when you keep getting caught with a right hook…\r\n\r\nOr a prospect cusses you out and hangs up on your cold call…\r\n\r\nOr you look like an idiot in front of your date because you\r\nstumble over your words and accidentally tell the waiter, “you\r\ntoo,” when they say, “have a good meal.”\r\n\r\nMomentum carries you through the shitty parts like this. Once\r\nyou’re in, there’s no going back because it’s like you can almost\r\ntaste what the other side will be like.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I was reminded of this very concept.\r\n\r\nI sat down to record a YouTube video, and 36 tries later, when I\r\nwas about to quit, I told myself that this was my last try and I\r\nwas following through with it no matter what.\r\n\r\nI imagined how I’d feel after finally making and uploading the\r\nvideo.\r\n\r\nAnd I told myself, “You’re already this far in; you might as well\r\nfinish the job.”\r\n\r\n​You can watch that video here.

All the employees are wearing reindeer ears and the\r\nmale barista attempts to hold eye contact with me for a few\r\nmilliseconds too long.\r\n\r\nI evade and tell him to make me an $8 iced latte with vanilla.\r\n\r\nBefore I got here, I was scouring my apartment. I tore up my\r\noffice, dug under the couch, swept through the kitchen, and even\r\nlooked in my bathroom although I knew there was little chance I’d\r\nfind what I was looking for in there.\r\n\r\nIt’s not that I even wanted to find the item that bad, it’s that\r\nI knew it was there somewhere which was driving me crazy.\r\n\r\nBut for now, I’m listening to Christmas music at this cafe\r\nbecause I had no luck finding my airpods.\r\n\r\nI rarely wear headphones. But when I do, it’s because I’m in a\r\nnoisy area and I want to write. Listening to my own music helps\r\nme feel like I’m in my own world where I can ignore the\r\ndorky-looking man at the counter to my right wearing a fanny pack\r\naround his shoulder.\r\n\r\nI literally remember putting them on my counter yesterday.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone broke into my apartment, ignored the expensive\r\nwatches, my car keys, and any other more valuable items they\r\ncould’ve taken, and decided to run away with my disgustingly\r\nearwax-stained airpods. Hahaha.\r\n\r\nI had something I wanted to write to you about, but I’ve gotten\r\nso sidetracked that I completely forget it now. I guess it’s just\r\nthat kind of morning.\r\n\r\nSomething that’s been on my mind however is career paths.\r\n\r\nI don’t understand how people can stay in one role in the same\r\nfield for more than a few years.\r\n\r\nEspecially as entrepreneurs. Maybe I’m just immature, but\r\nthinking about doing the same exact thing I’m doing now for the\r\nnext 3 years makes me want to chew glass.\r\n\r\nSure you can always make the argument that “feelings don’t\r\nmatter. Do it anyway” blah blah.\r\n\r\nAnd I know there will always be some things I don’t want to do in\r\nany business I run. But to me it just makes sense to upgrade or\r\nswitch business models every few years (if that’s what feels\r\nright).\r\n\r\nI get bored doing the same thing every day after a while.\r\n\r\nAgain, you can make a sound argument that it doesn’t matter how\r\nyou feel and that you should power through the things you don’t\r\nwant to do.\r\n\r\nBut you can also make the counterargument that if you can find\r\nexcitement in your work, you’ll be much more effective than when\r\nyou’re dreading it. Even if that means your business model has to\r\nchange or evolve every so often.\r\n\r\nLast point on this and then I gotta run: I’m not saying you\r\nshould constantly be jumping from one completely different\r\nbusiness to another.\r\n\r\nYou likely have innate skills that can be applied in a variety of\r\ndifferent ways, and sometimes being open to the application of\r\nyour skill set in a similar or parallel field may make sense.\r\n\r\nYou with me here?\r\n\r\nI could be completely wrong, but thanks for reading anyway.

    "body": "Merry belated Christmas.\r\n\r\nNot gonna lie I’m kind of excited for the Holiday season to be\r\nover and to get back into the natural swing of things.\r\n\r\nTo me, it’s always felt like Holidays are just for people who\r\nhate their normal lives and want to soak up their annual two-week\r\nbreak from reality.\r\n\r\nMaybe I’m just a grumpy asshole, but I like my normal reality.\r\n\r\nI went to the dentist for the first time in a while today, and he\r\nwas asking about my business.\r\n\r\nThere’s an art to being able to describe what you do to people\r\nwho are not in your world.\r\n\r\nI explained how I run marketing for people who sell coaching and\r\ninformation online.\r\n\r\nTo help him understand, I told him that if he were to get on\r\nsocial media and make educational videos about how he started his\r\npractice, he would naturally garner an audience of people who\r\nwould pay to learn more from him.\r\n\r\nHe then understood. And I had no cavities, so that was pretty\r\ncool.\r\n\r\nThe online education industry still blows my mind sometimes.\r\n\r\nNearly anyone who has acquired any niche skill has the capability\r\nto share their story on social media and find people who are\r\nwilling to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to learn from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWith the boom of short-form content, it’s never been easier to\r\nstart making minute-long videos from your iPhone, and *boom* now\r\nyou have a potential seven-figure business.\r\n\r\nThis is the situation for every single one of my clients.\r\n\r\nWe’ve been working with a client who buys small local businesses.\r\n\r\nIt’s a much more complicated process than I’ll make it sound\r\nhere, but basically, he has a system that allows anyone with a\r\nstable income and some money to invest to acquire a “boomer”\r\nbusiness that cashflows around 6-figs per year right off the bat.\r\n\r\nThe process of finding a type of business that’s a good buy is\r\nthe most complicated part, but once an acquisition is complete,\r\nhe can operate the business remotely and only spend about an hour\r\nper week on each business, making sure nothing catches on fire.\r\n\r\nHe started making content on social media, and just months later,\r\nwe’re doing multi-six-figure months, and he’s got dozens of\r\nsuccessful students.\r\n\r\nThere’s no real lesson here today, but I just wanted to make it\r\nclear how simple it can be to launch and scale an online\r\neducation company.\r\n\r\nI’ve got something coming for you soon if you’re someone who is\r\nbuilding this type of business or something similar, so be on the\r\nlookout for my emails over the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nLet’s hit the gas and build a life in 2024 where you don’t have\r\nto “look forward to the Holidays” because your whole life feels\r\nlike a Holiday :)\r\n\r\nThanks for reading my words today.

    "body": "I’ve been in the online marketing space for about three years\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThroughout this time, I’ve met a lot of people who were trying to\r\n“make it” as entrepreneurs. Some completely failed, some\r\nstagnated, and others have been on par with the same level of\r\nsuccess I’ve seen or have found financial success quicker than\r\nme.\r\n\r\nObviously, there are unicorns, but for the most part,\r\nintelligence doesn’t seem to play a huge role as long a baseline\r\nlevel of competence is established.\r\n\r\nIt’s similar to being a professional athlete – at the highest\r\nlevels, everyone is a “freak” athlete. It’s the minimum standard,\r\nand generally, the intangibles are what separates the good from\r\nthe great.\r\n\r\nHere are a few of the less tangible traits I see in my more\r\nsuccessful friends (which those who stagnate or fail seem to\r\nlack):\r\n\r\n1. Ingenuity & craftiness: In the world of entrepreneurship,\r\nrules are meant to be broken, loopholes are meant to be found,\r\nand the lines between what works and what doesn’t are blurred.\r\n\r\nThere’s a proclaimed “right way” to find success, and then\r\nthere's the way that actually works for you.\r\n\r\nCreativity and persistence will (sometimes) take you much further\r\nthan blindly following a “proven system” that other people tell\r\nyou to.\r\n\r\n2. Discipline & the ability to create order in chaos: Freedom\r\ncauses most people to lose their minds. When you’re accustomed to\r\nbeing told what to do, what to think, and where to be, having to\r\ntell yourself those things is a big adjustment.\r\n\r\nBuild a system for yourself that works for you. Again, it doesn’t\r\nhave to be what other people are doing as long as it puts you in\r\nan environment and mental space that allows you to do what you\r\nneed to do.\r\n\r\n3. Comfortable with the unknown: Eventually, you come to the\r\nrealization that no matter how much you plan, no matter how hard\r\nyou try, and no matter how badly you want something to happen,\r\nyou are not in complete control of the outcome.\r\n\r\nCertainty makes us feel safe. And if you’re too attached to that\r\nfeeling of safety, go get a desk job and a 401k. Or prepare to\r\nalways have a voice in the back of your head that thinks\r\neverything is gonna crumble at any given moment.\r\n\r\nBonus trait 4 - The gut feeling paradox: There’s a balance\r\nbetween listening to signs from the universe that tell you that\r\nyou need to make a change versus jumping from one shiny object to\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when things don’t feel right, it’s a sign that you\r\nneed to make a change.\r\n\r\nOther times, when things don’t feel right, it’s a sign that\r\nyou’re on the cusp of something great if you can power through\r\nthat feeling.\r\n\r\nThis is a constant game. I don’t have any advice on how to\r\nnavigate it because truthfully, I don’t know if anyone does.\r\n\r\nI guess that brings us back to trait #3, huh?\r\n\r\nAlrighty, hope you liked this one. Keep pushing these next few\r\ndays and build momentum going into 2024.\r\n\r\nHappy hump day, let me know if you read this whole thing\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Simple.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoyed my anti-self-improvement turned self-improvement\r\nemail.\r\n\r\nLove ya,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6hdrel6nalh8wnq777\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6hdrel6nalh8wnq777\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6hdrel6nalh8wnq777/08hwh9hdd3m394tl/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

Shit makes me nervous.\r\n\r\nI immediately started thinking of excuses I could come up with to\r\nget out of it.\r\n\r\nMaybe I’ll plan a trip that weekend so that I have a legitimate\r\nreason to say no.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps I’ll say my dog ate my computer and I can’t make the\r\nPowerPoint presentation. Or maybe I’ll start licking door handles\r\nand kissing homeless people so I can be sick that day.\r\n\r\nUgh.\r\n\r\nAs my conscious thoughts run through a variety of excuses, I have\r\na feeling in my stomach that tells me that I have to say yes.\r\n\r\nThis is a common occurrence among the things we don't want to do.\r\n\r\nIt can be as simple as when someone invites you to dinner, and\r\nyou initially try to say no, but somehow you get roped into\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nThen you end up having a good time, and you're glad you went.\r\n\r\nBut our ego wants to protect us. It wants to talk us out of\r\nputting ourselves in any position where there’s an opportunity to\r\nlook like a fool or be challenged in any way.\r\n\r\nI could get up there, start my presentation, and forget how to\r\npronounce my own name and lose my ability to speak english.\r\n\r\nImagine I do the whole thing in Spanish and no one understands\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut in reality — detached from the fragile, overbearing ego\r\nthat’s inside of all of us, I know that it’s an experience\r\nthat’ll be good for character development in the movie that I\r\nstar in inside my own head.\r\n\r\nAnd the last email (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh24e7qzu2hxv6ez66/qvh8h7hrr377o8tl/aHR0cHM6Ly9ja2FyY2hpdmUuY29tL2IvNjh1ZWg4aGt6dzdubGNrcTg4Z3FtdHo3dnhra2s=\r\n) I wrote to you was literally about how getting over “the\r\nflinch” is all you need to be successful.\r\n\r\nSo that’d be extremely hypocritical of me to bitch out because\r\nI’m nervous.\r\n\r\nIf there’s one thing I want you to take away from my rant today,\r\nit’s this:\r\n\r\nYou have conscious thoughts that your ego feeds you as a\r\nprotection mechanism.\r\n\r\nAnd then you have your gut feeling.\r\n\r\nLearn to decipher the difference between the two when you’re\r\nmaking a decision, and it might lead you to experiences that are\r\nnecessary for your development.\r\n\r\nOr you’ll embarrass yourself and never listen to me again.\r\n\r\nHappy New Year,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh24e7qzu2hxv6ez66\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh24e7qzu2hxv6ez66\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh24e7qzu2hxv6ez66/9qhzhnhpp8qqzdh9/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

It’s also clear that I’m not\r\nanother self-proclaimed “expert agency owner” who regurgitates\r\nthe same three talking points.\r\n\r\nThis makes it so people develop a bit of a relationship with me\r\nand my idealogy before we ever get on the phone.\r\n\r\nI’m telling you all this in order to show you that many things\r\nyou may think you need to find success are often a facade.\r\n\r\nWhether you run an agency or a completely different type of\r\nbusiness, your success often boils down to a few key factors.\r\n\r\nOnce you understand what those factors are, double down on them\r\nrather than wasting time trying to find the next magic pill that\r\nwill carry you to the promised land.\r\n\r\nRepeat successful actions, and success becomes inevitable.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you liked this one,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

You’re doing it right.\r\n\r\nBut if you’re like me – and like most people, you know in your\r\ncore that you’re not even scratching the surface of your\r\npotential.\r\n\r\nEven if things are good.\r\n\r\nHell, that’s honestly more dangerous. You get some money, a fun\r\nlifestyle, a girl or 10… it’s easy to throw in the towel and feel\r\nlike you’ve won.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe you have won by most people’s standards.\r\n\r\nBut you know that it’s not complete. It’s not even close.\r\n\r\nThat doesn’t sit right with you. So even though you’re “living\r\nthe dream,” that voice in your head doesn’t go away.\r\n\r\nIt’s the same voice you heard when you felt compelled to start a\r\nbusiness or make any life-altering change.\r\n\r\nIt eats you up silently.\r\nYou suppress it and tell yourself false narratives and stories in\r\nan attempt to remove its power.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it works temporarily.\r\n\r\nBut on a long enough time horizon, you just can’t seem to shake\r\nit.\r\n\r\nEventually, you’ll be left at a crossroads where you have to\r\ndecide whether or not you’re going to quench those urges and step\r\ninto the reality that you know is possible for you.\r\n\r\nOr continuously attempt to fool yourself and risk sabotaging your\r\nlife in the process.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the only way to ensure that you’re rarely disappointed\r\nis to do your best.\r\n\r\nAs long as you do that, there will never be “what ifs.”\r\n\r\nSure, things won’t always go your way. But you’ll sleep knowing\r\nyou did everything in your power with the resources you had on\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nYou’ll find peace in the fact that you actually fucking tried.\r\n\r\nYou get one shot at this. Don’t half-ass it.\r\n\r\nAlright even motivation, can we stop saying “Happy New Year” now?\r\n\r\nIt’s the 4th. Nobody was saying Merry Christmas on NYE.\r\n\r\nI hope this made you feel some fire in your soul if you made it\r\nall the way down here, and if it did, you’ll probably like this\r\ntoo.

Learn how to provide a service or build a product that solves\r\na problem for other people.\r\n\r\n2. Find a mechanism to get clients or customers.\r\n\r\nThat’s it.\r\n\r\nRepeat that process a bunch of times, and then you no longer have\r\nto look at price tags.\r\n\r\nI’ve grown to believe that you cannot develop into the highest\r\nversion of yourself until you’re in complete abundance\r\nfinancially.\r\n\r\nWhen you have to worry about menial expenses and constantly chase\r\ncash, it distorts your lens of reality.\r\n\r\nYour broke “life coach” has two motives. First, they need to keep\r\nyou as a client. Second, they want to help you just enough but\r\nnot too much so that you’re “fixed” and can leave.\r\n\r\nSorry, I’m rambling here.\r\n\r\nLast thing I’ll share today:\r\n\r\nI’m opening up a small consulting group exclusively for people on\r\nthis email list.\r\n\r\nIt’ll be fairly expensive and isn’t for complete beginners.\r\n\r\nBut it should be pretty dope and “VaLuAble” for people who are in\r\nthe online coaching space, run agencies, or simply want to chat\r\nwith me on a more intimate basis (no homo).\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested, just reply to this email and let me know so\r\nthat I can have Russian hackers send you a phishing link and\r\nsteal your credit card info.\r\n\r\nI know this one was a bit all over the place, so thanks for\r\nsticking with me Bo.\r\n\r\nHappy Monday,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "I just knocked out most of the client work I had for the day as I\r\nsit here in a crowded coffee shop in the middle of Brickell.\r\n\r\nI’m drowning out the noise in here with a random Spotify playlist\r\nblasting in my headphones.\r\n\r\nThe song “Sweater Weather” came on a few minutes ago. Absolute\r\nbanger.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've got a good one for you today (I think).\r\n\r\nI’ve never publicly shared a ton about the ins and outs of how\r\nwe’re scaling our clients' info-product businesses because it’s\r\nalways felt a bit boring.\r\n\r\nHonestly, scaling a coaching program or course business to\r\n$500k/mo+ is shockingly simple.\r\n\r\nI know that may sound like a crazy amount of money, but here are\r\nsome of the main things I’ve learned about how we got there *by\r\naccident.*\r\n\r\n- Traffic solves all. You can have the best offer in the world,\r\npay me $20k to build out your funnels, and hire Jordan Belfort as\r\nyour closer. But none of it will matter if you don’t have\r\neyeballs.\r\n\r\n- If you can’t crack organic content, you should probably get a\r\n9-5. Seriously. If you have something to sell and you’re unable\r\nto get attention on the internet in 2024, you should be an\r\naccountant instead. The entire multi-7-figure business I’m\r\nwriting about was built off of short-form content.\r\n\r\n- Do not forget to build your plane while you’re flying it.\r\nBecause these businesses scale so fast, there’s a lot of added\r\ncomplexity to the product and fulfillment side. If you neglect\r\nthe customer experience, you will crash and burn on a long enough\r\ntime horizon.\r\n\r\n- Systems only matter at scale. We neglected a lot of the\r\noptimizations and organizational aspects of the business until we\r\nwere already making multi-6-figs per month. Until then, we only\r\nfocused on more traffic, more webinar registrants, and more\r\nbooked calls.\r\n\r\n- There is no secret sauce. I can’t emphasize this enough: Build\r\noffer, get attention. Build offer, get attention. Build offer,\r\nget attention. Fix everything else later. The degree to which you\r\ncan scale is dependent on your ability to consistently bring more\r\npeople into your funnel who know, like, and trust you.\r\n\r\nEnough writing for today.\r\n\r\nI hope this helped you in some way, and if it didn’t, thanks for\r\nwasting some time with me.\r\n\r\nBy the way, there were a lot more people than I anticipated who\r\nreplied to my email yesterday (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh24w7o5b2hxv6ez66/kkhmh6hln363vgsl/aHR0cHM6Ly9ja2FyY2hpdmUuY29tL2IveG11cGg2aHJvZTNvN2hybnBwdm5xYzAzbHBrbGw=\r\n) about the consulting group that I’m opening up.\r\n\r\nI’m still mapping out the details in my head, but I’ll have more\r\ninfo for you soon.\r\n\r\nThanks for chatting with me today.\r\n\r\nTalk soon,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh24w7o5b2hxv6ez66\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh24w7o5b2hxv6ez66\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u0o3z624hoh24w7o5b2hxv6ez66/58hvh7hmgzkz2vb6/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "Sometimes I get lazy.\r\n\r\nI procrastinate.\r\n\r\nTasks that should take 3 minutes to complete end up taking weeks\r\nbecause I put them off for so long.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I’ve had periods where I’m super locked in and\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nAfter I dropped out of college, I spent the following 3 months in\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nI’d wake up early every morning, hit the gym, bike home, take\r\nsales calls, spam more prospects, check in with my clients, write\r\ncopy, and make content.\r\n\r\nThere was no room to be lazy.\r\n\r\nIf I skipped one thing, everything else would fall apart.\r\n\r\nThe whole “time freedom” fantasy is a bit of a trap.\r\n\r\nNot having any obligations sounds great in theory, but if you\r\ndon’t have the discipline to fill your time with productive\r\nactivities that help you generate momentum, you’ll fail.\r\n\r\nThink about these three instances:\r\n\r\nGuy quits his job.\r\n\r\nKid drops out of school.\r\n\r\nGirl breaks up with guy.\r\n\r\nEach of these usually acts as a catalyst for a big life change –\r\neither positive or negative.\r\n\r\nAll the time and energy that was spent working, studying, or\r\nreminding your girlfriend to drink water is now freed up.\r\n\r\nSome people replace those things with a structured routine, and\r\nothers don’t.\r\n\r\nMost cannot handle freedom.\r\n\r\nBut obviously, this is all paradoxical because too much structure\r\nmakes you a dork, and too much freedom makes you lazy.\r\n\r\nHere’s what reminded me of this concept:\r\n\r\nLast night, I ordered a cheesesteak on Uber Eats.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t just any cheesesteak.\r\n\r\nImagine God himself transmutes into a hard-working (likely\r\nMexican or Cuban) man who sets up a ghost kitchen on Uber Eats\r\ncalled “Chef Pepper.”\r\n\r\nAs I waited for Liana to weave through traffic on her motorbike\r\nto deliver my order, I remembered that the last thing on my long\r\nto-do list for the day was to make a YouTube video.\r\n\r\nI’d already had a busy and productive day, so why not see if I\r\ncould knock out a video in the 10 minutes that I’m waiting here?\r\n\r\nI set up my iPhone camera and started yapping.\r\n\r\n7 minutes and 19 seconds later, I had a semi-coherent ramble that\r\nI had enough confidence in to upload on the World Wide Web.\r\n\r\n​(you can watch it here btw) (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/lmun5487w2hmh0e6xexc6hdx03600/dpheh0h0e7q9n2sm/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9BeEp0aGM4SU5oNA==\r\n)​\r\n\r\nFunny how that works, huh?\r\n\r\nI’d procrastinated for 27 days since making my last video, but\r\nonce I entered a race against a cheesesteak, I was able to knock\r\nit out in less than 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nPressure spurs you into action. If you’re not competing, you’re\r\nlikely stalling.\r\n\r\nEven if it means you have to find creative ways to jumpstart your\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\nHappy hump day,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "Before I get into today's message, quick update on the consulting\r\ngroup I’m putting together:\r\n\r\nTo be quite honest, I’ve been going back and forth on the idea,\r\ndebating whether or not it’s the right time.\r\n\r\nBut if you’ve been reading my emails for a while, you’ve probably\r\nheard me say the “perfect” time never comes.\r\n\r\nI decided to take my own advice.\r\n\r\nThis week, I’ll be launching “The Bader Group.”\r\n\r\nOnce launched, the application window will be open for a few\r\ndays, and then I’ll close the doors for a bit.\r\n\r\nMore details on the way in future emails.\r\n\r\nThat being said, let's get into it…\r\n\r\nI often think about what I’d do if I lost everything.\r\n\r\nBank account gets wiped clean, housekeeper steals my watches, and\r\nall my clients drop me.\r\n\r\nThis thought honestly excites me more than it scares me.\r\n\r\nI could throw in the towel, sell the rest of my possessions, and\r\nmove back home with my parents.\r\n\r\nOr figure out a way to make money fast so I can uphold the\r\nlifestyle I’m living right now.\r\n\r\nLet’s pick the latter.\r\n\r\nIf I still had my personal brand, network, and skillset, I’d be\r\nabsolutely fine.\r\n\r\nIt’d probably light a fire under my ass to go 10x harder than I\r\nam right now.\r\n\r\nThe three assets I mentioned above are the ultimate safety net.\r\n\r\nOnce acquired, it’s nearly impossible to go broke.\r\n\r\nBut one thing I realize as I think about this hypothetical\r\nsituation is that my next move becomes rather obvious.\r\n\r\nIf I needed money fast, I’d start pitching people on Instagram\r\nand Twitter. I’d sell anything I could to my audience. I’d find\r\nways to help my friends in their businesses.\r\n\r\nAnd because I’d be on a real-life clock against time, I know I’d\r\nbe absolutely relentless.\r\n\r\nTake a second now to think about what you’d do in this situation.\r\n\r\nWho can you go to for help?\r\n\r\nWhat’s the easiest way you can make an extra $10k?\r\n\r\nWhat value can you provide to other people?\r\n\r\nWhen you picture yourself in this predicament, you may realize\r\nthat the solutions you come up with could be implemented right\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nIf you feel like you’re stuck or you’ve stalled out at a certain\r\nincome threshold, odds are you’re just not being resourceful\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nMaybe you’re a bit too comfortable, and although you tell\r\nyourself you want to progress, your desire doesn’t outweigh the\r\npain of change.\r\n\r\nThis leaves you with a few options:\r\n\r\n1. Do nothing and stay in this constant state of unease where\r\nyour actions don’t meet your desired reality.\r\n\r\n2. Do nothing and accept that you are comfortable where you are,\r\neven if you’re selling yourself short.\r\n\r\n3. Act like you just donated your livelihood to a stripper and\r\nget back to work with a newfound ferocity.\r\n\r\nThe choice is yours – Just some food for thought.\r\n\r\nTalk to you tomorrow Bo,\r\n\r\nBen.\r\n\r\nP.S.

Sure, the terminally ill people are\r\nlikely gonna die soon anyway, but that’s a lot of blood on your\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThis is the way I see the majority of the info products on the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nMost people will fail.\r\n\r\nAs an education business scales, a few things happen that start\r\nthe degradation of their client success rate.\r\n\r\nFirst, they start selling to beginners and idiots.\r\n\r\nOftentimes, if you want to get to $300k/month+, this is the only\r\nway to do it (although there are anomalies).\r\n\r\nAnd naturally, when the quality of your customer decreases, so\r\ndoes the effectiveness of your product.\r\n\r\nThey buy courses and never open them. They ask for a refund or\r\nchargeback after doing 1% of the work.\r\n\r\nThese are the terminally ill. They were never gonna make it\r\nanyway. And you’re better at spending their money than they are,\r\nright?\r\n\r\nThe second reason success rates decline is because it’s fucking\r\ndifficult to manage hundreds (or thousands) of customers.\r\n\r\nMany won’t get the support they need unless they proactively seek\r\nit out.\r\n\r\nPlus in some situations, teaching a large batch of people the\r\nsame methods to start a business can make those methods less\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nDoes this make selling info products immoral or evil?\r\n\r\nHere’s the flip side:\r\n\r\nLet’s say 100 people buy a course that teaches them how to start\r\na marketing agency.\r\n\r\n95 people give up after a few months and lose the few hundred or\r\nfew thousand dollars they’d spent on the course.\r\n\r\nBut 5 people actually commit to building this business.\r\n\r\n6 months to a year later, they’ve completely changed their lives.\r\nThey’ve quit their 9-5s, dropped out of college, and paid off\r\ntheir parents' medical bills.\r\n\r\nFast forward a few years, and one of them has amassed millions of\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThat person now employs a dozen people, supports their family,\r\nand inspires thousands of others online.\r\n\r\nSo, was that worth it?\r\n\r\nSure, a little blood was spilled, but think about all the good\r\nthat came out of it.\r\n\r\nAnd after all, who are we to be judges of morality?\r\n\r\nIf you read this far, hit reply and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nTwo last things for you:\r\n\r\n1. Enrollment for my 1-on-1 & small group consulting is closing\r\nin a few days.\r\n\r\n​Go here to apply before the deadline on Sunday.

I pay\r\nabout $20k per year to be in the group.\r\n\r\nHe hosts a quarterly mastermind at his house in Miami, where\r\nhe’ll have a handful of speakers talk about a variety of topics\r\nand give a presentation of his own.\r\n\r\nIf you were reading my emails earlier this month, you may\r\nremember me saying that he invited me to speak.\r\n\r\nI gave my presentation this morning.\r\n\r\nHere are some things that I found interesting from giving my own\r\ntalk and some of the other speakers today:\r\n\r\n- Most of the time, you’ll be glad you said “yes” to doing things\r\nyou initially felt resistance towards.\r\n\r\nWhether it’s a business opportunity, speaking at an event, or\r\nsaying yes to the voice in your head that tells you to go up to\r\nthe pretty girl.\r\n\r\nThe more you can overcome that resistance, the more it loses its\r\npower, and you’ll laugh that you were ever nervous.\r\n\r\n- You do not need to be back against the wall to find motivation.\r\nYou need to manufacture internal dialogue that tells you to make\r\nmore money.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to be inspired when you have no other options. But as\r\nyou find success, you need to move out of “survival mode,” and\r\nyour vision needs to get bigger.\r\n\r\nSet goals and envision a lifestyle that gives you a reason to\r\nmake more money – especially if you have enough money to live\r\ncomfortably for the next 3 years sitting in your checking\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n- Your current reality is a lagging indicator of your previous\r\nactions and habits.\r\n\r\nThe future version of you 6 months – 1 year – and 10 years down\r\nthe line is the result of what you do today.\r\n\r\nFigure out what you want that future to look like and reverse\r\nengineer the daily actions you need to take to make it\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nThe three lessons above may sound basic or elementary to you, but\r\nmost of the time, we don’t need revolutionary new advice.\r\n\r\nWe need to be reminded of the fundamental elements that lead to\r\nsuccess and we need to actually practice them.\r\n\r\nThese masterminds always remind me how small I’m playing and how\r\nmuch further I have to go.\r\n\r\nIf you feel an equal need to get substantially richer, the\r\napplication for my 1-on-1 and small group consulting is closing\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\nNo pressure and no fake scarcity, but this is one of your last\r\nchances to apply before our calls start on Monday.\r\n\r\n​Go here now to learn about The Bader Group.

    "body": "I met a homeless man while restocking on zyns a few minutes ago.\r\n\r\nHe wasn’t all the way there mentally, but enough to tell me his\r\nname was David and make some small talk that didn’t necessarily\r\nconfide within the usual “weather and sportsball” chit-chat.\r\n\r\nHe first told me that God had answered his prayers and that he\r\nwas going to see his family in 13 days.\r\n\r\nWe walked towards the back of the rundown 7/11 together to get\r\nhim a “brew.”\r\n\r\nHe said he was from New York, and that word was a part of their\r\nslang.\r\n\r\nIn this case, “brew” meant a large gold four loko (which is\r\nutterly insane to be drinking casually).\r\n\r\nAs we made our way back to the counter, he told me that he’d\r\nspent 15 years in prison for trafficking cocaine, and it’d been\r\ntough ever since.\r\n\r\n“I thought I was God, and it was a big mistake,” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI told him I’d been there (not prison but rather feeling\r\nimmortal).\r\n\r\nIt was a refreshing interaction.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cards may not have fallen in his favor, he was in\r\ngood spirits and seemed excited to enjoy the brew and pack of\r\nNewports I’d just bought him.\r\n\r\nOn my way home, I walked by Myron (fresh and fit guy) and Sneako\r\nfilming a video.\r\n\r\nThey’d set up a table and chairs on the street corner with a sign\r\nthat read “Why women deserve less.”\r\n\r\nAs I walked by, a bus full of large, screaming women drove past\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nIt’s one of those 2 story party buses that blasts music through\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nMy friend Mason has coined them the “brokie buses.”\r\n\r\nI think we all appreciated the perfect irony as they panned the\r\ncamera from the “Why women deserve less” sign to the brokie bus\r\nfull of hippos.\r\n\r\nI’m sure that made for good content.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I’m excited for the coming week.\r\n\r\nLife has a way of reminding you of what you need to hear at the\r\nperfect time – if you’re open to receiving it.\r\n\r\nIt’ll guide you in the right direction when you’re looking for\r\nanswers and shoot you down when you’re flying too close to the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThe more I’ve relied on intuition and divine guidance, the more I\r\nsee how everything is connected.\r\n\r\nYour relationships, work, habits, and even quick interactions\r\nwith homeless people.\r\n\r\nIt’s all intertwined and likely relaying an important message if\r\nyou’re cognizant enough to receive it.\r\n\r\nHave a killer week, and don’t participate in drug trafficking,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

We’ll make a bunch of future\r\nall-stars and live vicariously through them as I grow old and\r\nstart taking TRTs so I can keep up with my much younger model\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nHahaha.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of girls, I’ve been reflecting on some things I’ve\r\nlearned about dating recently.\r\n\r\nFirst, women are amazing.\r\n\r\nNearly every girl I meet is pleasant to be around and has their\r\nown unique vibe (if they’re comfortable enough to show that side\r\nof themself to you).\r\n\r\nDon’t listen to the losers who tell you Western women are ruined.\r\n\r\nSure, not every girl you meet is gonna be a potential wife, and\r\nthat’s okay.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding this allows you to appreciate them for who they are\r\nand simply have fun.\r\n\r\nIt also gives you a more complete perspective on what qualities\r\nyou look for in someone you would take more seriously and\r\npotentially date.\r\n\r\nNext, take it slowwwwwww.\r\n\r\nIf you scroll through TikTok, you’ll see “dating coaches” say\r\nthat you need to commit to someone within 1-3 months.\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely crazy in my opinion. Normalize 6-12 month\r\ntalking stages. Sometimes longer.\r\n\r\nSeriously.\r\n\r\nIt takes time to get to know someone. There are many things\r\nyou’ll learn about them that will only come out over time.\r\n\r\nRushing into a relationship is a surefire way that it’ll go up in\r\nflames.\r\n\r\nAnd no, this isn’t just a way to keep your freedom and avoid\r\nexclusivity.\r\n\r\nIt ensures that you guys actually know each other before you put\r\na label on it. Because that label will only complicate things.\r\n\r\nLittle fights turn into UFC matches (not physically, I hope) and\r\nif the foundation of the relationship isn’t rock solid, it’ll\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\nLast thing and most important one.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a girl reading this, you should stop here. I’m sorry it\r\nhas to be this way, but it does.\r\n\r\nThe solution to 99% of your “girl problems” is solved by having…\r\n\r\noptions.\r\n\r\nLots of them. 3 Barbies, 2 Cinderellas, a Tinekerbell, and maybe\r\na Harley Quinn or 3.\r\n\r\nThis sounds bad when I say it out loud like this, but I’m doing\r\nso for a reason:\r\n\r\nDetachment.\r\n\r\nNeediness has to be the #1 turn-off for women. And when she’s\r\nyour only option, she can feel it.\r\n\r\nWomen are intuitive little creatures. They’re actually harder to\r\ndeceive than men.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re someone who truly has options, you care less about\r\nlosing one of them, and it changes your entire demeanor.\r\n\r\nYou’re not a dancing monkey trying to impress her. You’re you.\r\n\r\nThey’ll never admit it, but they like a man with options.\r\n\r\nCrucify me. But I’m right.\r\n\r\nOk, enough for today. Lmk if you liked my takes on this topic and\r\nwant to hear more.\r\n\r\nTake a pretty model on a date tonight,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Or coffee\r\nshops? Merging onto a highway?\r\n\r\nIt’s like their systems get overloaded, and they revert to monkey\r\nbrains, where they just start making sounds and looking for\r\nbananas.\r\n\r\nAnyway, let’s talk about more important things.\r\n\r\nImagine you’re building yourself a car.\r\n\r\nYou get all the parts you need and spend countless hours\r\nconfiguring your vehicle.\r\n\r\nFinally, you’re ready to hit the road.\r\n\r\nYou hop in and start driving.\r\n\r\nAt first, it’s great. You’re excited to finally enjoy the fruits\r\nof your labor.\r\n\r\nBut after a few hundred miles, the engine starts making a strange\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nYou pull over and pop the hood.\r\n\r\nIt’s a minor problem, and you know exactly what you need to do to\r\nfix it.\r\n\r\nYou close the hood and tell yourself you’ll fix it later.\r\n\r\nAs you continue driving, you see another car and are immediately\r\nenamored.\r\n\r\n“That’s the kind of car I want,” you think to yourself.\r\n\r\nWhen you get home, you order parts and set out to build it.\r\n\r\nOver the next few months, you start neglecting car #1, and the\r\nminor problem with the engine has turned into a much bigger\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nInstead of fixing it, you spend all your time building a new car.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, once your “perfect” car is ready, you hit the road.\r\nAnd the cycle continues. You see a new car you like better,\r\nneglect your own, and start all over.\r\n\r\nSee where I’m going with this?\r\n\r\nThis is how many of us treat our businesses, relationships, and a\r\nvariety of other endeavors.\r\n\r\nWe spend so much time laying the foundation for what could be\r\nsomething special.\r\n\r\nBut once the novelty wears off and we realize the constant\r\nmaintenance that’s necessary for continuous progression, we start\r\nlooking for the \"new thing.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of putting our feet on the gas and maximizing what’s in\r\nfront of us, we let what we’ve built deteriorate so that we can\r\nhave an excuse to start all over.\r\n\r\nIt’s a familiar comfort. It allows for the illusion of\r\nproductivity. But it keeps you stuck.\r\n\r\nAnd don’t you want to find out how far you can go if you can\r\nresist the urge to turn your head every time you see a new girl\r\nin a red dress?\r\n\r\nWater your own plants. Today, tomorrow, and especially in 6\r\nmonths when it’s no longer as exciting.\r\n\r\nThx for reading,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6hdrxopqulh8x7k277\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6hdrxopqulh8x7k277\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6hdrxopqulh8x7k277/3ohphkh73evo44tr/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

Action. Action.\r\n\r\nThat’s it. Don’t be stupid.\r\n\r\nThis email is especially simple to prove to you that I am no\r\nsmarter than you.\r\n\r\nAll of my friends are relatively rich.\r\n\r\nAnd all of my friends are likey no smarter than you either.\r\n\r\nDo not be dumb. Get rich. It’s easy.\r\n\r\nEnough motivation for today.\r\n\r\nGonna go do things that will make me money!\r\n\r\nI recommend you do the same :)\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6hdr73vqtlh8x7k277\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6hdr73vqtlh8x7k277\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6hdr73vqtlh8x7k277/6qheh8h7l4eqvnho/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

They lift\r\nyour energy and make you feel better about yourself.\r\n\r\nRecently, I’ve noticed that people generally perceive me quite\r\npositively.\r\n\r\nI’ll get random invites to things, girls will pursue me to an\r\nextent, service workers love me, and I have absolutely amazing\r\nfriends in my life.\r\n\r\nI’m not saying this to gloat here.\r\n\r\nI’ve had times in my life where it feels like I’ve been perceived\r\nas the exact opposite of what I just described above.\r\n\r\nIf I had to boil down what’s changed for me into one word, it’d\r\nbe this:\r\n\r\nExpression.\r\n\r\nPeople like it when they can be themselves. They like it when\r\nthey know they’re not gonna be judged or used for some ulterior\r\nmotive.\r\n\r\nAnd the easiest way to get people into this state is to be in it\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re truly you – you say what you want, you’re honest,\r\nyou’re observant… it creates this genuine look in your eyes and\r\nyour smile.\r\n\r\nPeople can just sense it.\r\n\r\nBut this is only developed when you cultivate enough respect for\r\nyourself to stop suppressing who you really are.\r\n\r\nSo let me remind you:\r\n\r\nYou are uniquely you.\r\n\r\nYou’ve overcome every hurdle you’ve encountered.\r\n\r\nYou’ve relied on yourself in times of hardship and uncertainty.\r\n\r\nAnd you got yourself through it.\r\n\r\nThere's a voice inside you that knows the way.\r\n\r\nThat trusts you fully.\r\nThat accepts you for who you are.\r\n\r\nYou owe it to that voice to bring it to life.\r\n\r\nAnd when you do – you deserve the world.\r\n\r\nBe you, bo.\r\n\r\nLove ya,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/27ukzem834hohv9rvxpc3hr54qw44\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/27ukzem834hohv9rvxpc3hr54qw44\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/27ukzem834hohv9rvxpc3hr54qw44/n2hohvh3vd985xb6/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "I saw my ex today.\r\n\r\nShe’s not really my ex because I never asked her to be my\r\ngirlfriend, but nonetheless, we shared a lot of time together and\r\nmany amazing memories.\r\n\r\nSeeing her from across the restaurant that we used to go to\r\ntogether was strange.\r\n\r\nWe waved and briefly said hello as she walked by on her way out.\r\n\r\nI got back from a 4-day bender in New York yesterday.\r\n\r\nWe didn’t do much other than go to dinner and the club with the\r\n20 girls (literally) that we brought, but it was fun for obvious\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nMy sincere apologies for neglecting you over the last two weeks.\r\n\r\nOver the last 6 months, my lifestyle has taken a complete 180.\r\n\r\nI barely went out during the first 10 months I lived in Miami.\r\n\r\nWhile I had a circle of a few close friends, I was never the one\r\nto initiate the plans or make an effort to find exciting things\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, it started feeling like I wasn’t my own person.\r\n\r\nI became an extension of my friend group, who lacked his own\r\ninterests, hobbies, and network.\r\n\r\nAnd most of my nights were spent sitting at my desk with a lit\r\ncandle and some music in the background, clicking buttons on my\r\ncomputer.\r\n\r\nNow, nights like this are rare, and I have an added appreciation\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nWhile the work I did during the time when I lacked a social life\r\nlaid the groundwork for us getting to 6 figure months with my\r\nagency, life feels a lot fuller now.\r\n\r\nI’m sure there will be a time when I go back to being a bit more\r\nof a hobbit, but this work-hard, play-hard lifestyle is much more\r\nenjoyable for my current stage.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the things I did that allowed me to build a fun\r\nsocial life while continuing to grow my business:\r\n\r\n1. Delegation\r\n\r\nI sent a $30,000 wire to a team member/friend today.\r\n\r\nBringing him on was one of the best decisions I’ve made.\r\n\r\nIt’s made it much easier for me, freed up my time, and the\r\nquality of work we’re able to deliver has improved.\r\n\r\nAfter all, money is just a number on a screen until you put it to\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nIf you’re unwilling to sacrifice some margin, have fun being\r\ntrapped at your desk all day.\r\n\r\n2. Branching out\r\n\r\nI went out of my way to make new friends and build a bigger\r\nnetwork in Miami.\r\n\r\nOnce I met one or two well-connected people, it created a\r\nsnowball effect in my social life.\r\n\r\nOutside of just my network, I started to “branch out” by taking\r\nup new hobbies, like boxing and tennis.\r\n\r\nFinding new interests and hobbies like this helped me reinvent my\r\nperception of myself.\r\n\r\nThis helped reshape my identity and made me feel like I had more\r\nexciting things going on in my life.\r\n\r\n3. Social media\r\n\r\nIf you go look at my Instagram toward the end of July, you can\r\nsee a shift occur.\r\n\r\nEven my facial expression and demeanor appear more confident in\r\nmore recent photos.\r\n\r\nI know it may sound superficial, but putting effort into making a\r\nbetter-looking Instagram and posting consistently on TikTok has\r\nopened so many doors and brought me a world of connections.\r\n\r\nThese three things helped me enter a version of myself that I\r\ncouldn’t access previously.\r\n\r\nMy lifestyle is exactly the way I envisioned it when I pictured\r\nliving in Miami.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is just a “side quest” to the main mission (getting\r\ndisgustingly rich), it’s brought me a lot of clarity and taught\r\nme lessons that I couldn’t have learned at my desk.\r\n\r\nCheers to life-maxxing.\r\n\r\nCall your ex today,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "I’ve been grinding all morning and am now trying to switch my\r\nbrain back to creative mode to write this email.\r\n\r\nThis would be a lot easier with a zyn, but I quit (again) 3 days\r\nago.\r\n\r\nOne thing I’ve realized recently is that everyone is dumb.\r\n\r\nEven smart people.\r\n\r\nActually, especially smart people.\r\n\r\nAll of the rich young dudes that you see on social media are\r\nlikely no more intelligent than you.\r\n\r\nThey’re unorganized, naive, and negligent.\r\n\r\nThe key to their success is simplicity.\r\n\r\nThey have a few personality traits and skills that allow them to\r\nthrive – and they’re dumb enough to double down on those two\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I was telling a friend how the majority of advice I\r\ngive to people who are trying to scale their agency or coaching\r\nprogram goes as follows:\r\n\r\nMe: “What have you done that’s worked so far?”\r\n\r\nAgency guy: “I got 3 clients by sending cold DMs.”\r\n\r\nCoaching guy: “I sold 5 people who found me on TikTok.”\r\n\r\nMe: “Okay, do more of that.”\r\n\r\nDo you see how stupidly simple this is?\r\n\r\nBut it’s literally the secret.\r\n\r\nFind something that works – do it a lot.\r\n\r\nThe same thing goes for your day-to-day life.\r\n\r\nHighs and lows are natural.\r\n\r\nI’ll have part of my day where I feel like the world is ending\r\nand other parts where everything seems perfect.\r\n\r\nI know that I am in a better mental state when I occupy my mind\r\nwith productive tasks.\r\n\r\nThe more progress I make, the less stressed I become and the\r\nbetter I feel.\r\n\r\nI think the key here is identifying your non-negotiable daily\r\nhabits that keep you sane.\r\n\r\nFor me, some of these are writing, making content, journaling,\r\nwalking, and boxing or lifting.\r\n\r\nNo matter what, you won’t be in a peak mental state every day –\r\nthat’s just not realistic.\r\n\r\nBut if you identify a few things that keep you at least around a\r\n6 or 7 out of 10 each day, and you’re consistent with them, you\r\ncan decrease the power of the tide in your emotional state.\r\n\r\nThis email is kind of a culmination of half-baked ideas, but I\r\ngotta go meet a friend for lunch, so we’re gonna end this here\r\nfor today.\r\n\r\nTalk tomorrow, thx for reading,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/qdurvx4oenh7h7wzvx0flhnpndrkk\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/qdurvx4oenh7h7wzvx0flhnpndrkk\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdurvx4oenh7h7wzvx0flhnpndrkk/dpheh0h089oxmnum/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "Yesterday, I saw a clip of Johnny Manziel talking about how\r\ndepressed he was during his first couple of years playing in the\r\nNFL.\r\n\r\nHe said Lebron, who was his childhood hero, would call him a few\r\ntimes a week to hang out, and he’d decline because he didn’t want\r\nto leave the house.\r\n\r\nLooking at this from the outside in, here’s what I gather:\r\n\r\nOnce you begin to get the things you want, you gradually\r\ninternalize that they won’t change anything.\r\n\r\nBy “things you want,” I don't just mean material items or\r\nlifestyle, but also your outward perception.\r\n\r\nYou can get all the praise, respect, and validation.\r\n\r\nYou can be the guy other dudes envy and girls want to be with.\r\n\r\nThis comes with a lot of pressure, which can break you if your\r\nself-image isn’t rock solid.\r\n\r\nThe expectations of others start to weigh on you, and your\r\nstandards rise to a level that takes a lot to maintain.\r\n\r\nIf you feel undeserving, you manifest that idea into reality.\r\n\r\nYour motivation dwindles, you lack discipline, and you start to\r\nlet your problems add up.\r\n\r\n“You can’t outperform your self-image.”\r\n\r\nThe weight of the contrast between how others perceive you versus\r\nhow you perceive yourself causes you to crumble.\r\n\r\nThat make sense?\r\n\r\nAnyway, a guy in front of me at this coffee shop is reading the\r\nbook “7 Habits Of Highly Effective People.”\r\n\r\nHe’s mouthing the words as he reads, which I find interesting.\r\n\r\nWhen I walked in to order my coffee, the barista told me she\r\nliked my hoodie and replied, “Ben 10” when I told her my name was\r\nBen.\r\n\r\nI found that endearing, so I gave her the Van Cleef bracelet off\r\nmy wrist.\r\n\r\nOne time, I sat next to Johnny Manziel at dinner (I think I told\r\nyou about that in an email months ago).\r\n\r\nNot long after, he DM’d the girl I was with that night.\r\n\r\nShooters shoot, I guess.\r\n\r\nLast thing – Yesterday, I was journaling and asked myself, “What\r\nwould make your life better than it is right now?”\r\n\r\nIt was easy to come up with an answer to that question, and I\r\nfound it interesting that my answer had little to do with more\r\nmoney or anything flashy.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to ask yourself the same thing when you have 20\r\nmin today.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, and hope you enjoyed,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hd999p7crh5x5e699\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hd999p7crh5x5e699\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hd999p7crh5x5e699/8ghqhohlqree22bk/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "Spotify and I haven’t been getting along recently.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I’ll hit shuffle and it’ll give me one banger after\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nOther times, it force-feeds me the same 6 songs until my mind\r\ngoes numb from the repetition.\r\n\r\nFor the last few weeks, it’s been the latter.\r\n\r\nPer usual I’m sitting at an ultra-liberal, hipster coffee shop,\r\nhoping that I’ll get a good idea to write about before I bore\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThere’s a bulletin board of post-it notes in front of me with a\r\nbunch of Pinterest-esque quotes.\r\n\r\n“Be happy! Enjoy 2024”\r\n\r\n“You are loved!”\r\n\r\n“Smile! Today’s a great day”\r\n\r\nOutside the quotes, a combination of people likely identify as\r\n“creatives” are promoting their work.\r\n\r\n“Need graphics? DM me on Instagram! @arthoe6969”\r\n\r\nThere are over 100 sticky notes and “business” cards on here.\r\n\r\nPlus a lost cat flyer in the top right corner.\r\n\r\nIn the middle, nearly covered up by the self-love propaganda,\r\nthere’s a note that says, “Be here now.”\r\n\r\nProbably a lesson in there.\r\n\r\nBeing present is something that’s a constant battle for me.\r\n\r\nTwo summers ago, I was on a beach in Greece, watching the sunset\r\nwith a bunch of friends.\r\n\r\nInstead of admiring the view, I was stuck in my head, stressing\r\nover whatever was happening in my business then.\r\n\r\nI remember looking around at my friends and wondering if they\r\nwere thinking about something else too, or if I was just broken.\r\n\r\nLast night, a client of ours ran a webinar (where we made over\r\n$100k) and was asked the question:\r\n\r\n“How do you deal with stress as an entrepreneur?”\r\n\r\nHe said, “I don’t… Nothing that I do is stressful,” and moved on\r\nto the next question.\r\n\r\nAs simple as this answer was, I found it interesting.\r\n\r\nWhat you give your attention to grows.\r\n\r\nThe people who wrote these stupid little quotes on the board in\r\nfront of me are probably unhappy.\r\n\r\nThey’re so obsessed with positive affirmations – and fearful of\r\nanxiety, that they bring their fears to fruition.\r\n\r\nThe “self-love” reminders attempt to convince themselves that\r\nthey don’t hate themselves.\r\n\r\nA happy person doesn’t need a reminder to be happy. They just\r\nare.\r\n\r\nIt’s almost like when you’re overly conscious about improving\r\nyour mental health, it has an inverse effect.\r\n\r\nDictating how you feel can be as simple as making a decision.\r\n\r\nSimply decide not to stress over something, stop giving it power,\r\nand it goes away.\r\n\r\nWhen my client on the webinar was asked that question, it was\r\nlike the idea of stress didn’t even exist in his world… he was\r\nalmost confused.\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, worrying and over-analyzing do nothing but\r\nexacerbate the problem.\r\n\r\nMaybe the answer is to bE hEre noW!\r\n\r\nCorny but true.\r\n\r\nI’m gonna start meditating.\r\n\r\nHope you and your Spotify shuffle get along today,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/75u8gdmwq5s8hkl2lqwazhqgqro66\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/75u8gdmwq5s8hkl2lqwazhqgqro66\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75u8gdmwq5s8hkl2lqwazhqgqro66/l2hehmh3r5o0wwf6/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

I took a personality quiz, changed my return\r\nflight, got ahead on some work, and did enough research on LA\r\nrestaurants that I could write one of those gay “Top 10 MUST TRY\r\nspots in LA” blog posts.\r\n\r\nJust so you know, I’m in seat 1A. There’s no reason for me to\r\ntell you this, but I figured I’d tell you anyway.\r\n\r\nLet’s talk about money and identity.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started making some money a few years ago, my mental\r\nwell-being became entirely reliant on my monthly income.\r\n\r\nWhen I’d hit a new all-time high, I’d be over the moon.\r\n\r\nI was more confident, I spoke with conviction, and I generally\r\nfelt and acted much more positively.\r\n\r\nConversely, when my monthly income stagnated or regressed, I lost\r\nall confidence and was in a constant state of panic.\r\n\r\nWhen I’d talk to people, I wasn’t really there. I was physically\r\nthere, but my mind would drift, drowning out the person who was\r\ntalking with my own thoughts.\r\n\r\nThese times were interesting.\r\n\r\nThis fight-or-flight mode wasn’t pleasant, but I think it helped\r\nme progress quicker.\r\n\r\nAll I thought about was business.\r\n\r\nRecently, it’s been the opposite. I honestly don’t know if it’s\r\nbeen a good or bad month for the agency numbers-wise.\r\n\r\nWe did help a client make $400k in 4 days recently which was\r\npretty cool.\r\n\r\nHe paid us our commission in crypto, so I threw all that money\r\ninto a meme coin.\r\n\r\nBack to the main point - I’ve been the opposite of “locked in”\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\nLocked out?\r\n\r\nOpened in?\r\n\r\nNot sure of the correct term.\r\n\r\nEveryone loves to act like they’re always working so hard.\r\n\r\nThis may cause you to feel like you constantly need to be at war,\r\nas it did for me.\r\n\r\nIt also meant my self-image was tied to my income.\r\n\r\nWhile I think that can be a good thing to an extent, it’s a\r\nhamster wheel that no amount of money can get you off of.\r\n\r\nSure, if you’re not growing, you’re dying — but growth can come\r\nin many forms.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t always mean you’re doubling your monthly income or\r\nspending 12 hours a day at your desk.\r\n\r\nMaybe it means you’re traveling more, building deeper\r\nrelationships, beating your friend Jimmy in 2K, etc.\r\n\r\nSimply side questing.\r\n\r\nAnd know there will be a time when you need to lock back in.\r\n\r\nYou can’t just coast forever — but sometimes, momentary coasting\r\ncan help you return to work with an added excitement.\r\n\r\nOr at least that’s what I’m telling myself.\r\n\r\nI'm about to land and gotta wrap this up, but there is one last\r\nthing I want to add…\r\n\r\n*Everything I just said does not apply to you if you don’t have\r\nenough money to fulfill the immediate image that pops into your\r\nhead when you think about having money.\r\n\r\nFor me, that image is the exact life I’m living now.\r\n\r\nI imagine for me to find the motivation to push beyond where I’m\r\nat now, that vision must evolve.\r\n\r\nOk, I just landed. Gotta go. Missed you, let me know if this one\r\nmade sense to you.\r\n\r\nBye from 1A,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkd8g7xivhpdg97rr\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkd8g7xivhpdg97rr\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkd8g7xivhpdg97rr/l2hehmh3r2r4nzb6/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

I’m not evolving or working towards anything.\r\n\r\nAnd admittedly, I started to take my foot off the gas.\r\n\r\nThis life I aspired to attain began to feel empty, and I was left\r\nwith the feeling of…\r\n\r\n“What now?”\r\n\r\nStagnation served as a punch.\r\n\r\nStay in the same place for too long, and you become predictable.\r\n\r\nBecome predictable, and you get hit.\r\n\r\nBut the solution is simple.\r\n\r\nYou gotta keep moving.\r\n\r\nReach a milestone, great. What's the next level you can get to?\r\n\r\nPicture it.\r\n\r\nMaybe it’s a house in the hills, more supercars, and the ability\r\nto fly private whenever you want.\r\n\r\nOr you don’t want to feel an ounce of anxiety on any purchase\r\nunder 6 figures.\r\n\r\nYou want a penthouse, your girl wants a Birkin, and you want to\r\nput a family member on payroll to do nothing.\r\n\r\nSure many of these are materialistic, but it’s your reality – you\r\ncan design it however you’d like.\r\n\r\nYou’ve just begun to taste freedom. You’re not even scratching\r\nthe surface of how you could live, and you’re getting\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nDon’t rob yourself.\r\n\r\nTrue freedom has no bounds, and the only limits come through your\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nLet your imagination run free, and you’ll create a new movie in\r\nyour head that you aspire to live in.\r\n\r\nThat's your new goal.\r\n\r\nStart building towards it now unless you want to wait until you\r\nget knocked on your ass.\r\n\r\nAnd by then, it’ll be a hell of a lot harder to get up.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, and I promise I’m really back for good this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nLmk if you liked this one,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkdp8pzivhpdg97rr\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkdp8pzivhpdg97rr\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkdp8pzivhpdg97rr/9qhzhnhpnq5q5kh9/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "There are some elements of spirituality that I find rather\r\nstupid.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, I hired a “life coach.”\r\n\r\nAfter our first call together, I decided I didn’t need him and\r\nwould instead take life advice from myself.\r\n\r\nHe was one of those meditate in Bali, peace and self-love types.\r\n\r\nThis is loosely related to the topic of this email, but it popped\r\ninto my head when I started thinking about spirituality.\r\n\r\nIf manifestation and the law of attraction sound a bit out there\r\nto you, I’m gonna try to break down what I believe these concepts\r\nto be as simply as I can.\r\n\r\nYour subconscious is constantly working either for or against\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nWhen you set goals and intentions, you give your subconscious a\r\ndirection to follow.\r\n\r\nWhen you fail to do so, your brain finds another way to occupy\r\nitself that likely isn’t conducive to the reality you want to\r\nbuild.\r\n\r\nThe most simple example of this that I see is in my habits and\r\ndaily routine.\r\n\r\nMaking content every day has been a priority of mine for a while.\r\n\r\nI’ve noticed I’m the most consistent, and content ideas come to\r\nme easily when I’m intentional.\r\n\r\nIf I write “tweet 3 times” or “make 2 videos” on my to-do list\r\nfor the day, my subconscious starts to help me out.\r\n\r\nI’ll be walking to the coffee shop to get an iced vanilla latte\r\nfrom a blue-haired barista with an Adams apple who calls\r\nhim(her?)self Megan, and boom – I’ll get a random idea for a\r\nvideo.\r\n\r\nCould it be a coincidence?\r\n\r\nSure. But nearly every time I set intentions like this,\r\ncompleting the action becomes easier.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is just one basic example, I hope it’s starting to\r\nillustrate the point.\r\n\r\nWhat you focus on and put your attention toward grows, even if\r\nyou’re not conscious of it.\r\n\r\nIf you’re obsessed with reaching a new income level, your brain\r\nis constantly working on that problem in the background.\r\n\r\nYou’ll get an idea while you’re driving or doing some other\r\nmindless activity, and it’ll be the key to reaching that next\r\nmilestone you’re aiming for.\r\n\r\nYou might feel like the idea came out of nowhere, but it’s likely\r\nbecause you’ve given your subconscious something to occupy itself\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nAnd eventually, it finds the solution.\r\n\r\nThe same thing goes for anything that you want in life.\r\n\r\nIf you can create a clear image of the lifestyle, people you’re\r\nsurrounded by, what you’re doing for work, how your routine\r\nlooks, and the general way of life you want to build…\r\n\r\nAnd you work towards those things…\r\n\r\nThe combination of the work and setting intentions will\r\neventually reach a perfect storm and you’ll feel like everything\r\nsomehow ended up exactly how you wanted it.\r\n\r\nThe way that your goals unfold likely won’t be how you imagined,\r\nbut that’s a topic for another email.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoyed this one and it made sense to you.\r\n\r\nHappy Friday,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "I’ve grown to love the peaceful Sunday night at home.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in school, this day was always dreadful.\r\n\r\nMonday morning was around the corner and the looming stockpile of\r\nwork I’d been procrastinating was staring me in the face.\r\n\r\nI was just debating whether or not I’d write an email to you\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nThere are a million excuses my brain could come up with as to why\r\nI shouldn’t.\r\n\r\nBut then I thought about the feeling I get after completing one\r\nof these.\r\n\r\nIt’s like when the endorphins kick in after a tough workout.\r\n\r\nMaybe you didn’t want to do it, but you always feel better once\r\nit’s done.\r\n\r\nThere are many things that we resist even though we know they’re\r\ngood for us.\r\n\r\nIf you’re building a business you can likely think of a few off\r\nthe top of your head.\r\n\r\nThe boring 30 minutes of outreach.\r\n\r\nThe long meeting with your sales team.\r\n\r\nOr the time spent planning your week to stay on track with your\r\nnext income goal.\r\n\r\nUsually, with tasks like this, the only immediate reward you get\r\nis internal.\r\n\r\nGoing to the gym once won’t add 15 pounds of muscle.\r\n\r\nYou won’t close a client right after sending 20 DM’s.\r\n\r\nAnd writing this email does nothing for me financially at the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nBut these things give us that type of dopamine that can only be\r\nearned when we know we’re doing something positive for our future\r\nselves.\r\n\r\nWhen a goal is accomplished, it’s a lagging indicator that shows\r\nyou consistently completed those sometimes monotonous actions\r\nthat yield you next to nothing in the short term.\r\n\r\nAs I contemplated writing this, I considered how I felt yesterday\r\nafter I clicked send.\r\n\r\nI knew replicating that same feeling would be worth it (plus, I\r\nactually enjoy writing these).\r\n\r\nSo I guess that’s my first piece of advice:\r\n\r\nAny time you resist something good for you, think back to how you\r\nfelt after the last time you did it.\r\n\r\nAnd if it’s something that you’ve never done before, replace that\r\nimage with anything else you once felt a sense of accomplishment\r\nafter completing.\r\n\r\nIf you can’t think of anything, you’re cooked.\r\n\r\nBut if you can, use it as fuel to complete the task in front of\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThis is how you rewire your brain to crave long-lasting, deserved\r\ndopamine rather than cheap, social media-infused dopamine.\r\n\r\nIt’s like how you view a relationship with someone who is easy to\r\nget versus someone you have to work for.\r\n\r\nYou’re always gonna place more value on the person who’s a\r\nchallenge because you had to earn it, which shows they value\r\nthemself.\r\n\r\nWhen you bring a girl home after buying her two drinks and making\r\nfun of her shoes, that usually means she isn’t wifey material\r\nbecause if you could do it that easily, so could someone else.\r\n\r\nCompared to the more elusive girl, who, although she likes you,\r\nwants to make sure you’re really the person you appear to be\r\nbefore she fully trusts you.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s the difference between cheap dopamine and deserved\r\ndopamine.\r\n\r\nThe more you can teach your brain to run toward the hill that’s\r\nharder to climb, the better.\r\n\r\nAnyway, hope you’re avoiding the Sunday scaries and ready to\r\ncrush the week.\r\n\r\nTalk tomorrow,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​Read my previous emails here (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluew470l3hnh4xx50ptph2k9d500/g3hnh5h3xovvz0fr/aHR0cHM6Ly9iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vcG9zdHM=\r\n)​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/zluew470l3hnh4xx50ptph2k9d500\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/zluew470l3hnh4xx50ptph2k9d500\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluew470l3hnh4xx50ptph2k9d500/9qhzhnhpn37728s9/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

    "body": "I’m 37 minutes into an hour-long Tai Lopez rant on YouTube and\r\njust clicked pause to write this.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I wrote a tweet about shifting your identity and\r\nwanted to expand on it.\r\n\r\nIt’s long, so it’ll take up the majority of this email, but I\r\ngenuinely think this is one of the keys to making continuous\r\nprogress in any realm of life.\r\n\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\nThe speed at which you progress is dependent on your ability and\r\nwillingness to shift into a new identity when you complete the\r\nvision you were formerly working toward.\r\n\r\nWhen you actualize financial/lifestyle goals, it’s like you’re\r\nbeating a level in a video game. the next level is an entirely\r\ndifferent game, and you’re starting at zero with new obstacles\r\nthat you’re unfamiliar with.\r\n\r\nSometimes, you may fail or refuse to move to the next level\r\nbecause you’re comfortable with the current level you’re\r\noperating at and the problems associated with it.\r\n\r\nThis is where you get trapped.\r\n\r\nStay in one identity for too long, and your lack of progression\r\nstarts to eat away at you.\r\n\r\nSo, you begin to sabotage your current reality because you want\r\nto feel like you’re moving forward.\r\n\r\nThe only way to do that while avoiding a complete shift in your\r\nidentity is to first move backward and then go back up the ladder\r\nyou already climbed.\r\n\r\nSo you’re now spending your time beating the same level of a\r\nvideo game only to click the reset button and start over.\r\n\r\nThis is the trap of stagnation, where you give yourself the\r\nillusion of progress.”\r\n\r\nI’ve found that whenever I feel stuck, it’s because I’m simply\r\nrefusing to step into a new identity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you’ve heard the saying, “The vehicle that gets you to\r\npoint A isn’t the vehicle that gets you to point B.”\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the person you are right now has a ceiling.\r\n\r\nYou can reach a certain level financially, emotionally, and\r\nspiritually.\r\n\r\nOnce you reach the peak of that level, you have the choice to\r\ncontinue progressing or stay where you are.\r\n\r\nAnd change is hard.\r\n\r\nThis is especially true when that change requires you to discard\r\nyour previous beliefs about yourself and replace them with\r\nbeliefs that will suit you in the new arena you are stepping\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nYou can spend eons avoiding this and fool yourself into believing\r\nyou’re making progress when you’re actually sputtering.\r\n\r\nBut this will only create an internal hell.\r\n\r\nYou know you’re capable of more, and you’re resisting.\r\n\r\nThe solution here can be summed up into three words:\r\n\r\nDecide, commit, act.\r\n\r\nDevise a plan to reach your next level, paint a vivid picture of\r\nhow this new version of you operates, and execute that plan.\r\n\r\nIt’s the work you’re avoiding, the habits you’re refusing to\r\ndevelop, and the beliefs that hurt to change.\r\n\r\nIt’ll be painful, but so will the feeling of staying the same.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the only way through.\r\n\r\nTalk tomorrow,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​Read my previous emails here.

    "body": "We procrastinate on the things we know we need to do most because\r\nwe are afraid of becoming the person who is capable of doing them\r\nconsistently.\r\n\r\nFor the last two weeks, the words “make a YouTube video” have\r\nbeen at the top of my to-do list.\r\n\r\nEvery day, I wake up and look at that task only to put it off to\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nToday, I finally got around to it, and it was a struggle.\r\n\r\nOver a dozen takes later, I gave up.\r\n\r\nI told myself, “At least you tried,” and turned off the camera to\r\ngo buy zyns.\r\n\r\nAs I stood in the hallway waiting for the elevator that was\r\ntaking obnoxiously long to arrive, I thought about how I still\r\nwouldn’t be able to cross that off my to-do list.\r\n\r\nThen, I considered how I’d feel if I’d accomplished it.\r\n\r\nThat’s when I turned around, walked back into my apartment, and\r\nmade this video.

    "body": "Happy Monday.\r\n\r\nI genuinely think 90% of the people I meet sell info (courses and\r\ncoaching).\r\n\r\nLiterally.\r\n\r\nI met a 96-year-old woman named Dorthy on my coffee run this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nWe started talking because she complimented my eyes and told me\r\nshe hoped her granddaughter would find a guy like me one day.\r\n\r\nShe then started telling me how she sells a course teaching\r\nelderly women how to keep their husbands happy by learning how to\r\nbake her special apple pie with a secret ingredient.\r\n\r\nThe ingredient reinvigorates their marriage and helps them find\r\nthat spark they felt years ago.\r\n\r\nIt’s called Viagra.\r\n\r\nDorthy grabbed my arm and asked if I wanted to try it.\r\n\r\nThat’s when I stole her cane and ran away.\r\n\r\nNow, I’m writing this fictitious story to you with Dorthy's\r\nimaginary cane leaning up against my desk.\r\n\r\nJokes and fictional stories aside, EVERYONE SELLS INFO.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a copywriter, I don’t think finding opportunities\r\nworking with coaches has ever been easier.\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is:\r\n\r\n* Become a competent writer and gain a fundamental understanding\r\nof how coaching businesses work.\r\n* Send loom video pitches on Instagram until you get someone on\r\nthe phone.\r\n* Talk to the potential client and see what they need. Maybe it’s\r\nemail copy, ad copy, video scripts, VSL scripts, funnel copy,\r\netc. You are a copywriter. That means your skillset is versatile,\r\nand you should be able to fill whatever gap they have in their\r\nbusiness to get your foot in the door.\r\n* Once you close the client, go above and beyond. The bar for\r\nservice providers is so low that if you simply put in more effort\r\nthan what is asked, you will be rewarded. They’ll send you\r\nreferrals, give you a case study, or trust you to operate other\r\nparts of their business (meaning you can now charge more + rev\r\nshare).\r\n* Now, you turn a $3k/month client into a $10k/month client.\r\n\r\nComplete the process above a few times, and you’ll be making more\r\nthan the average investment banker at Goldman Sachs.\r\n\r\nPlus, you didn’t have to snort Adderal and cheat off your smart\r\nAsian friend named Kevin for four years while getting your\r\nbachelor's degree.\r\n\r\nThat’s what I’d do if I had to start all over.\r\n\r\nEven if you’re not a copywriter, the process I outlined is\r\nbasically all you need to do to accelerate your success in any\r\nservice-based business.\r\n\r\nYour skillset gets you in the door, and you decide what happens\r\nnow that you’re in the room.\r\n\r\nIf you earn the trust of the right person, one connection could\r\nchange your life.\r\n\r\nJust be competent and over-deliver.\r\n\r\nNow you’re rich.\r\n\r\n​Thank me by watching this video and leaving a like and comment\r\n:) (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/lmun5487w2hmh09n0omf6hdxoe400/8ghqhohlkv8q85hk/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS8xZEZGZGU4VWp0ND9zaT02aW1xdmowV1daT2tKTWVx\r\n)​\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "Yo bo, big news…\r\n\r\nI ordered a whiteboard.\r\n\r\nIt comes with a stand, markers, and erasers.\r\n\r\nCool right?\r\n\r\nA problem I sometimes encounter when I sit down to write is that\r\nI start questioning whether the immediate idea that comes to mind\r\nis important enough to warrant an entire email.\r\n\r\nAs I sit here thinking about where to take this, I’ve probably\r\ndiscarded five ideas.\r\n\r\nAll of which could have made for a banger email.\r\n\r\nBut because I don’t feel they’re worthy, I sit here telling\r\nmyself my mind is blank.\r\n\r\nI recently wrote about how your standards determine your reality\r\nand that if you want to improve anything, you have to raise the\r\ninternal bar for what you perceive as acceptable.\r\n\r\nI’m now realizing the opposite is also true.\r\n\r\nI believe nerds call this a paradox.\r\n\r\n(side note real quick – Grammarly fucking sucks. It’s a tool that\r\ngives you suggestions on your writing, and everything it tells me\r\nto do sounds like it’s attempting to be an off-brand\r\nShakespeare).\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to the standards paradox.\r\n\r\nSometimes, if you don’t lower your standards, you won’t do\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nYou want to write the perfect message, make the best video\r\npossible, say the right line to the girl, or impress someone you\r\nlook up to.\r\n\r\nThe desire for perfection has an inverse effect.\r\n\r\nYou don’t start, or you filter your thoughts, and you find any\r\nexcuse not to approach the girl.\r\n\r\nThis is because the measuring stick is in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nInstead of setting an incredibly high bar for the quality of the\r\noutput, the bar needs to be set for the quantity of the input.\r\n\r\n“I need a big idea for this email” becomes “I need to write an\r\nemail today, no matter what.”\r\n\r\n“I need to say the right line to the girl” becomes “I need to\r\nwalk up and say anything.”\r\n\r\n“I need to impress this person” becomes “I need to express myself\r\nand say what I’m thinking.”\r\n\r\nYou’re optimizing for reps instead of trying to protect your ego\r\nby being perfect.\r\n\r\nSure, I want to “wow” you with every email I write.\r\n\r\nBut if I wait until I have a groundbreaking idea every time, I’d\r\nbe writing once a quarter.\r\n\r\nIf I make sure to get this done even when I don’t feel heavily\r\ninspired, the quality of the output increases in correlation to\r\nthe input.\r\n\r\nThat means do more of the thing, and you will get better at it\r\nway quicker than you would if you tried to do it perfectly.\r\n\r\nThere's a Harvard study about this.\r\n\r\nLong story short, students in a ceramics class were separated\r\ninto two groups. One group was told to make the “perfect” clay\r\npot, and the other was told to make as many as possible.\r\n\r\nAll of the best-looking pots came from the quantity group rather\r\nthan the quality group.\r\n\r\nYou should get the point by now.\r\n\r\nBe wary not to conflate having “high standards” with a defense\r\nmechanism to protect your ego.\r\n\r\nOdds are that when you fail to take action, you’re trying to save\r\nyourself the embarrassment of realizing that you have some\r\nimprovement to make.\r\n\r\nSo does everyone else – and those who improve the fastest are the\r\nones who get the most reps.\r\n\r\nGrammarly keeps giving me more dumb suggestions, so I’ll wrap\r\nthis up here, but go watch my recent YT video if you haven’t\r\nalready.

    "body": "I was having an amazing morning until now…\r\n\r\nIt’s a beautiful 78-degree day in Miami.\r\n\r\nBirds chirping, sun shining, and people genuinely seem happier\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nI walked to Soybucks to grab my iced shaken espresso. They\r\ngreeted me with love and told me to have a great day.\r\n\r\nI smiled and tossed the barista the keys to my G Wagon.\r\n\r\nThen, everything changed.\r\n\r\nI opened my phone and went to Instagram.\r\n\r\nBoom, I see another pitch from some little ass kid telling me he\r\ncould be my “growth operator.”\r\n\r\nHe said, “Ben, did you know you could monetize 1% of your\r\naudience??? I can make you $30k per month!”\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know what “growth operating” is, let me fill you in.\r\n\r\nYou partner with someone who has a big audience, help them set up\r\na Skool community, and take 50% of the profits.\r\n\r\nIt’s basically a simplified version of what we do at my\r\ninfo-product agency.\r\n\r\nObviously, I think it’s a solid business model to run, and it’s\r\nmade me 7 figures.\r\n\r\nBut I think there’s a bit of a misconception about how it’s been\r\npositioned online.\r\n\r\nFrom firsthand experience, I can promise you that helping someone\r\nscale an info-product is complex.\r\n\r\nThere are many moving pieces in these types of businesses, and\r\nyou need to have a broad skill set along with a general\r\nunderstanding of the info-product space to succeed as a service\r\nprovider.\r\n\r\nYou write email copy, build funnels, script video sales letters,\r\nbuild systems, and orchestrate the sales process.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a complete beginner, it’s damn near impossible to learn\r\nall these skills at once.\r\n\r\nInstead, it makes much more sense to start by learning one thing\r\nand one thing only – copywriting.\r\n\r\nIt’s the foundation of my business and the reason I’ve scaled to\r\n6 figures per month with my info agency.\r\n\r\nWe’ve scaled offers from zero to $600k/month and orchestrated\r\nover a dozen multi-six-figure launches.\r\n\r\nWe helped a client go from $30k/mo to $350k/mo in a month and a\r\nhalf, and our smallest clients are making a minimum of $1m/year.\r\n\r\nBut I didn’t end up in this position by saying I wanted to be a\r\n“growth operator.” That term didn’t even exist.\r\n\r\nI worked as a freelance copywriter/marketer and eventually\r\naccumulated the skills required to run a full-stack agency for\r\ninfo products.\r\n\r\nIf I were starting all over again, I’d start by becoming the best\r\ncopywriter I could be. I’d study all types of copy – emails, ads,\r\nsales pages, VSLs, direct mail, billboards.\r\n\r\nThen I’d start doing outreach to get clients while continuing to\r\nlearn supplementary skills like funnel building, the different\r\ntypes of funnels, when to use which, how to navigate zapier,\r\nsales process management, etc.\r\n\r\nOnce I had a better understanding of these things, I’d pitch my\r\ncopywriting clients on more services.\r\n\r\nGet one really good case study, and boom – now you have a real\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nLet me clarify, though: I’m not saying the growth operator\r\nbusiness model is bad. The guys who teach it are legit.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not a beginner business model, and you won’t get\r\nanywhere close to 50% profits from any creator who knows what\r\nthey’re doing.\r\n\r\nIf you’re starting from scratch, learn copy, and the next door\r\nwill open for you.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoyed this one,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​Read my previous emails here.

    "body": "Goood morning bo,\r\n\r\nBefore I start rambling and forget to tell you, I made a new\r\nvideo explaining how I’ve made $124,255 in a month as a\r\ncopywriter. You can watch it here after you read this. (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8kue9mz0kxhoh0vp4lvckhzp7n399b3/dpheh0h0r2g9gesm/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9yNDlweGt0QWZXNA==\r\n)​\r\n\r\nI’m sitting on my balcony as I write to you, and the dude who\r\nparades around the streets in Brickell while dancing on his bike\r\nis blasting the song “Dance Monkey.”\r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever been here, you probably know who I’m talking\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nHe usually annoys me, but I’m in a good mood today, so I’m\r\nrefraining from sniping him.\r\n\r\nAnyway, whenever I see someone online pushing a narrative really\r\nhard, it makes me think they’re trying to convince themselves\r\nthat it’s true.\r\n\r\nI’m sure we’ve all been guilty of this at some point.\r\n\r\nBut I keep seeing Alex Becker pop up on my Twitter timeline,\r\ntalking about how “fulfilled” he is by getting up at 3 am and\r\nsitting at his desk all day.\r\n\r\nHe’s a pioneer in the online money space, so no shade directly at\r\nhim – I just think that someone who is truly happy doesn’t have\r\nto tell you how happy they are.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, someone who’s found the right path for\r\nthemselves doesn’t tell you how your path is wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd a person who has a true relationship with God doesn’t judge\r\nyou for not following the same rules they follow.\r\n\r\nThis problem seems to arise when you deeply subscribe to a belief\r\nand discard anything that may contradict that belief. You don’t\r\nunderstand that most things are temporary and there are few\r\nuniversal truths.\r\n\r\nBut because you’ve fully convinced yourself that your way is the\r\nright way, when you encounter a situation where that belief is\r\nchallenged, you take it as a threat.\r\n\r\nIt’s why someone who follows the college, 9-5 route gets angry\r\nwhen they see a 16-year-old with their annual salary on their\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\nAnd on the contrary, it’s why a struggling entrepreneur feels the\r\nneed to criticize 9-5ers so they can solidify that they made the\r\nright choice in their own mind.\r\n\r\nThere’s a sliver of doubt that they’re attempting to cover up by\r\ndenying that any alternative could be true.\r\n\r\nBut that’s the thing – the alternative can almost always be true.\r\n\r\nOne thing I know with 100% certainty is that my outlook on life\r\nwill change over time. It’s supposed to.\r\n\r\nDifferent seasons in life bring additional perspectives.\r\n\r\nI’m not saying you should lack conviction in your current beliefs\r\nif you’ve thoughtfully crafted them.\r\n\r\nJust understand that they may change over time.\r\n\r\nDon’t marry your beliefs, or you’ll end up bitter when you see\r\nsomeone succeeding in a different lane than you.\r\n\r\nThere are a million ways to win. Choose yours.\r\n\r\nAlright, I gotta go to boxing, and you gotta watch this video.

    "body": "Hello and happy Sunday, bo.\r\n\r\nIf you’re in a cold or grey climate right now, I feel bad for you\r\nbecause Miami is absolutely beautiful.\r\n\r\nI’m wearing Birkenstocks without socks, which could be considered\r\na crime against humanity but is also indicative of the sunny\r\n80-degree day we have here.\r\n\r\nFirst, I want to say thank you for the love of my recent YT\r\nvideos. Your validation is giving me the motivation to upload\r\nconsistently, so please keep it up.\r\n\r\nRecently, I’ve been thinking about how copywriting has impacted\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nNot only has it helped me build my business, but it’s served as\r\nan outlet for me to develop more concrete ideas.\r\n\r\nFor the last couple of years, I’ve been journaling, tweeting, or\r\nwriting an email nearly daily.\r\n\r\nIt feels like a form of art.\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I’m taking ideas that are jumbling around in my\r\nhead and assembling them into a series of words that form a\r\ncomplete thought.\r\n\r\nThis has made me a more articulate speaker as well.\r\n\r\nWhether talking to friends, on a date, or making content, I feel\r\nthe ripple effect that comes from writing consistently.\r\n\r\nBeing able to use your words and share your perspective with\r\nsomeone in a way that may persuade them to agree with your\r\nbeliefs feels like a superpower.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you want to build a business that involves\r\ncopywriting, I genuinely think getting into the habit of writing\r\nconsistently is one of the highest ROI activities you can do.\r\n\r\nOnce you hone this skill, a world of opportunities opens up.\r\n\r\nIt can lead to a successful business, deeper relationships with\r\nothers, and/or a loyal audience of people on the internet that\r\nresonate with your beliefs.\r\n\r\nAnd as I think about the most successful entrepreneurs I know,\r\nthis is almost always their unfair advantage.\r\n\r\nSwitching gears a bit, another thing that’s been on my mind is\r\nthe value that comes with continuous learning.\r\n\r\nSchool tricked us into thinking that education is a boring chore.\r\n\r\nThis causes most people to put little time into gaining new\r\ninformation once they graduate.\r\n\r\nBut learning new things should be fun.\r\n\r\nI’m sure there are dozens of topics that you are naturally\r\ncurious about and would enjoy exploring further.\r\n\r\nAnd who knows – maybe it could lead to more money, a better\r\nsocial life, or at least give you an interesting topic to discuss\r\nat the dinner table.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re constantly learning new things, you become more\r\nunique and interesting. And being a wealth of knowledge is cool.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to take some time each day to learn about\r\nsomething new. It doesn't have to be about money or anything that\r\neven offers you any tangible benefit.\r\n\r\nSimply allow your curiosity to lead you and someway, somehow,\r\nyou’ll be glad you did.\r\n\r\nThis is a part of how you develop into a well-rounded version of\r\nyourself, which I talk more about here. (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hv8zeela6hrqdz344fn/z2hghnh30gp7mehp/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9TdU9fOXRGY185VT9zaT1DazBDcXpNUzRIUEtmUXN3\r\n)​\r\n\r\nAnyway, I gotta record some course content (which you’ll have\r\naccess to soon), and Grammarly is pissing me off again because it\r\nkeeps suggesting retarded edits to my writing.\r\n\r\nGo watch my latest YT video if you haven’t already :)\r\n\r\nLove you,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​P.S.

    "body": "I was working out with my boxing coach the other day, practicing\r\na new combination.\r\n\r\nWhile we train, he frequently pauses to give me an analogy or\r\nanecdote to help cement new concepts in my head.\r\n\r\nIn this particular session, he said something that gave me no\r\nother choice but to reply with the word “bars” because it applies\r\nto any area of life that you are aiming to improve.\r\n\r\nHe said, “Confidence comes through competence, which comes\r\nthrough repetition.”\r\n\r\nIn other words, the more reps you get, the better you become, and\r\nthe better you become, the more confidence you build.\r\n\r\nI’m noticing this already on YouTube.\r\n\r\nThe first time I sat down to make a video, it took me too many\r\ntries to count.\r\n\r\nI’d start talking and stumble over my words, lose my train of\r\nthought, or find an issue with the lighting or how the camera was\r\npositioned.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, making a video felt like I was climbing this big\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nAlthough I still run into occasional issues, it’s become much\r\neasier to sit down and knock out a video.\r\n\r\nWhile the quality is subjective, I also feel that my ability to\r\narticulate the concept I’m discussing in each video has improved.\r\n\r\nThe words flow more smoothly, I’m more comfortable being\r\nexpressive, and I’m getting closer to losing the filter that\r\nnaturally comes with making videos for the internet.\r\n\r\nIt’s a perfect example of the quote from my boxing coach.\r\n\r\nI don’t want to harp on this one point for too long because it’s\r\nso simple yet so difficult to actually practice.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I’ll say here is that I promise you with full\r\ncertainty that when you stop putting off things you want to do,\r\nit’ll be worth it.\r\n\r\nYou have to get over the immediate flinch that comes with\r\nstarting anything new and sometimes have to say, “fuck it if it\r\nsucks, it sucks,” and do it anyway.\r\n\r\nOver time and repetition, you will get better.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I gotta hop on a coaching call, so I’ll keep this one\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading – and go here to check out the video I\r\nuploaded today about why “monk mode” makes you less productive.

Grow up.\r\n\r\nA couple things on my mind today:\r\n\r\n1. Craftiness is the most underrated skill in business.\r\n\r\nIt’s the reason some people seem to get lucky.\r\n\r\nI know a newer copywriter who’s gotten to multi-five figures a\r\nmonth way faster than most people.\r\n\r\nHe’s a smart kid but considering he’s brand new to copywriting,\r\nit’s safe to assume there are many better writers than him.\r\n\r\nBut it’s the intangibles that have allowed him to scale to\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nI’ve watched him relentlessly follow up with prospects in a\r\nnonaggressive way that doesn’t piss them off.\r\n\r\nHe’ll confidently say “yes” when someone asks for something he\r\nhas little idea how to do and figure it out on the fly.\r\n\r\nHe’s simply the boy.\r\n\r\nI was talking to my friend Mason about this the other day.\r\n\r\nWhen I describe someone as “the boy” it’s one of the biggest\r\ncompliments I can give.\r\n\r\nIt means that they just get it. They’re a good vibe, people like\r\nthem, they’re socially calibrated.\r\n\r\nIt’s the highest rank in the Bader-dialogue hierarchy. A step up\r\nfrom “the homie” even.\r\n\r\nWhen someone has the traits above, they \"make it\" — even if\r\nthey’re not the most skilled.\r\n\r\nMy mentor when I was building my basketball trainer SMMA used to\r\nalways say that if we can get someone laughing on a sales call,\r\nthey will close.\r\n\r\nIt's a high ROI tip — in a world of cookie-cutter, boring,\r\nlifeless robots, be expressive. Crack the borderline offensive\r\njoke. Tell your prospect they need to hire you so they can afford\r\nbetter wifi when their connection cuts out on the Zoom call.\r\n\r\nSmile. And be handsome.\r\n\r\nI got carried away writing this first point and now I forget the\r\nother things that were on my mind.\r\n\r\nHmmm.\r\n\r\nI’m sitting outside at Starbucks and another corporate drone just\r\nrode by on a scooter.\r\n\r\nOh, next thing that that I was thinking about:\r\n\r\n2. If getting clients is a struggle, you’re being a bot.\r\n\r\nThis relates to my first point but THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.\r\n\r\n“I can’t get any clients, I’ve been sending the same retarded\r\npitch to everyone for 3 months and no one replies.”\r\n\r\nCHANGE YOUR PITCH.\r\n\r\nTest shit. That’s life. You test until something works for you,\r\neven if it goes against the “proven system” that cornballs on the\r\ninternet give you.\r\n\r\nOne of the copywriters I consulted with got his first couple of\r\nclients by digging through Youtubers channels, finding their\r\nemail addresses, and pitching them via email.\r\n\r\nNo one taught him that. But that’s ingenuity.\r\n\r\nThe first time I heard the word “ingenious,” I had just broken\r\ninto my high school gym to play basketball.\r\n\r\nThere was a hidden key in the storage closet to turn the lights\r\non and lower the hoops. I’d found it months before, but one day,\r\nI walked in there, and it was gone.\r\n\r\n“Goddamnit, Terry,” I thought to myself. She was the athletic\r\ntrainer who would always kick me out because it was a liability\r\nfor a minor to be in the gym without supervision.\r\n\r\nI bent the metal part of an old lanyard I found in my backpack\r\nand made a new key. It worked.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Terry walked in right after I used my makeshift\r\nkey to get the baskets down.\r\n\r\nShe asked how I did it, and I told her I had made a new key.\r\nThat’s when she said, “Well, that was ingenious of you.”\r\n\r\nIn my head, I was like “fuck yeah it was Terry.”\r\n\r\nAnyway, I’m rambling, but if you’re stuck right now, BE CRAFTY.\r\nBE INGENIOUS. DONT BE A LUKE BELMAR IMAN GHADZI ANDREW TATE\r\nCLONE. STEAL YOUR GRANDMAS COMPUTER. SELL YOUR KIDNEY ON THE\r\nBLACK MARKET.

    "body": "The hardest part of starting anything is the beginning.\r\n\r\nWhen I open this document to a blank page, and a blinking cursor,\r\na voice in my head tries to convince me that today isn’t the day.\r\n\r\n“You’re out of ideas for now. You’re uninspired. Just wait until\r\nit comes to you,” it says.\r\n\r\nThis is a familiar voice.\r\n\r\nI hear it whenever I turn on the camera to make a video.\r\n\r\nIt screams at me when the cold water touches my body in an ice\r\nbath and tells me to get out.\r\n\r\nMaybe you’ve heard it too.\r\n\r\nWhen you listen to it, you’ll be convinced not to go to the gym,\r\navoid approaching the girl, and wait until the “perfect time” to\r\nstart the business.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I listened to an audiobook about this topic\r\nduring a plane ride.\r\n\r\nIt’s called The War Of Art by Steven Pressfield.\r\n\r\nHe refers to this voice as “resistance” and describes it as “A\r\nuniversal force that has one mission: to keep things as they\r\nare.”\r\n\r\nYou’re likely aware of the things you resist – consciously or\r\nunconsciously.\r\n\r\nYou also probably don’t want to stay the same forever.\r\n\r\nAnd you know that the only way to change is to overcome your\r\ninitial desire to flinch when taking the first half step.\r\n\r\nYou can ask yourself three questions to identify what you’re\r\nresisting right now and make a convincing argument for moving\r\ntoward it.\r\n\r\nAnswer these with me real quick:\r\n\r\n1. What’s one thing I want that I’m not getting right now?\r\n\r\n2. What’s stopping me from getting this thing?\r\n\r\n3. What would happen if I could do this thing?\r\n\r\nGot it?\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nBy answering question one, you thought of something you want to\r\ndo that you’re avoiding.\r\n\r\nIn question two, you selected the first excuse that came to mind\r\nfor why you couldn’t do it.\r\n\r\nAnd in question three, hopefully, you realized how stupid that\r\nexcuse is because of the benefits, the person you become, and the\r\nnew life you unlock by overcoming your resistance.\r\n\r\nIt’s literally impossible to make a logical argument for why you\r\nshould avoid the things you’re avoiding.\r\n\r\nYour excuses are bullshit.\r\n\r\nThat’s your ego trying to defend against change.\r\n\r\nBecause with change comes the possibility that things don’t go as\r\nplanned.\r\n\r\nMaybe your video gets three likes, and they come from your\r\ngrandma, mom, and little brother.\r\n\r\nEven your cousin gave it a thumbs down.\r\n\r\nOr maybe you get rocked in the face the first time you step in\r\nthe ring.\r\n\r\nIf those are big enough reasons to stay where you are, be my\r\nguest.\r\n\r\nBut by making that decision, you’re also closing the door to the\r\npossibility that it will eventually work out.\r\n\r\nSure, maybe it will start slowly.\r\n\r\nMaybe things won’t go as planned even after you beat resistance.\r\n\r\nBut one day, your efforts will compound.\r\n\r\nYou’ll hang in there long enough and have the results to show for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThat’s when you’ll laugh at the fact that you ever were scared to\r\npursue the things you want.\r\n\r\nYou in?\r\n\r\nCool.\r\n\r\n​Now, go here and let me tell you about the one trait you need to\r\nmake as much money as you possibly want.

    "body": "Today was a tough one for my speaking ability.\r\n\r\nI probably have over 100 clips on my camera that will all be\r\ndeleted.\r\n\r\nEarlier today I was trying to make a VSL for a new offer I’m\r\nputting together where you can work with me directly.\r\n\r\nAfter dozens of takes, I finally had a video that I thought was\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nI exported it and was about to call it a day.\r\n\r\nThen I watched it a couple more times and decided that I didn’t\r\nlike it.\r\n\r\nI took a walk to clear my head and was inspired to make a Youtube\r\nvideo once I got back.\r\n\r\n20 takes later, I still didn’t have a complete video. The sun\r\nwent down and the lighting in my apartment makes the video look\r\ngrainy once it gets dark.\r\n\r\nI turned off the camera and am now sitting here writing to you.\r\n\r\nIt’s funny because yesterday I wrote an email to you about\r\novercoming the initial resistance you feel when starting\r\nsomething new.\r\n\r\nAnd today, I couldn’t beat it.\r\n\r\nI started to feel bad for myself after the initial VSL failure.\r\n\r\nAnd then during my walk earlier, I opened an email reply from\r\nsomeone on this list.\r\n\r\nThey said “Thank you Ben for rekindling this flame inside me with\r\nthese emails.”\r\n\r\nThat’s when I realized that the decision to pity myself after\r\nthings didn’t go as planned is incredibly selfish.\r\n\r\nI’m making videos and sharing content on the because it feels\r\nlike something I have to do.\r\n\r\nAs a byproduct, I get to inspire other people and impact lives\r\nfor the better.\r\n\r\nObviously, I’m not on the front lines here risking my life for\r\nthe benefit of humanity, but making\r\n\r\ncontent like this is probably one of the most influential things\r\nI can do with my time at the moment.\r\n\r\nWhen I think about, the possibility that I even impact a few\r\npeople for the better vastly makes up for days like today, where\r\nI struggle.\r\n\r\nI get messages and comments every day from people telling me that\r\nI’ve helped them in some way.\r\n\r\nAnd to say “woe is me” while sitting and pouting about a couple\r\nof unsuccessful videos is childish, bitch-like behavior. I have a\r\nresponsibility here, and it’s my obligation to uphold it. I’m too\r\nblessed to feel sorry for myself. The mission doesn’t allow for\r\npity.\r\n\r\nThis is the pep talk I heard in my head. Perhaps it applies to\r\nyou as well.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think the worst thing you can do in any situation\r\nis to feel sorry for yourself. It makes you powerless. It’s a\r\nslap in the face to anyone who supports you or roots for you, as\r\nyou’re not even giving the same level of respect to yourself.\r\n\r\nNo more pity parties. You have responsibilities to tend to and a\r\ndivine calling to follow.\r\n\r\nDon’t be a bitch.\r\n\r\nOk bye thx for reading Happy Friday.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "I started writing this in my head during my morning run.\r\n\r\nThe trail was abnormally crowded today.\r\n\r\nI had to weave through an abundance of slow walkers, oblivious\r\ndog owners, strollers, and preoccupied middle-aged Hispanic men.\r\n\r\nIt was windy, to the point that the water from the Miami River to\r\nmy left was blowing up onto the walkway.\r\n\r\nThe trees were rattling, but I pierced through the wind in my\r\nwhite Nikes, which I’ve been wearing for the past year.\r\n\r\nIt’s definitely time to buy a new pair, but completing minuscule\r\ntasks like going to the shoe store feels equivalent to climbing\r\nMt. Everest to me. So I’ll probably wait until the sole starts to\r\nfall off or my toes bust through the mesh.\r\n\r\nI was walking back home after my run when I ran into my friend\r\nBo. Bo is a copywriter that Mason and I have been coaching for\r\nthe last six months or so.\r\n\r\nShe quickly reached $10k per month inside Mason's program, the\r\nCopy MBA Inner Circle, and then started asking me for help\r\nscaling further.\r\n\r\nWith my help she’s scaled past $50k per month by turning her\r\ncopywriting business into a full stack info agency.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, I was thinking about how we could create more\r\nsuccess stories like hers.\r\n\r\nShe started by learning the skill of copywriting and then added\r\nmany of the other services that I offer to clients.\r\n\r\nThings like funnel building, VSLs, webinars, and building all the\r\nsystems on the backend.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this is the common path for those who get the best\r\nresults when first starting out as a beginner.\r\n\r\nThey get good at copy and then expand their skill set to become\r\nmore valuable to their clients.\r\n\r\nThis gave me the idea to partner up with Mason inside of Copy\r\nMBA.\r\n\r\nOver the last few weeks, I’ve been building out course content to\r\nadd to the program, and I’m nearly ready to launch it.\r\n\r\nIf you’re just starting out, this is gonna be a cheat code for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nNot only will you get access to Mason and his team, along with\r\nall of the existing content inside of there…\r\n\r\nBut you’ll also begin to learn the skills that you’ll need to\r\nknow to eventually be able to charge clients up to $40k in a\r\nsingle month the way I have.\r\n\r\nI’m putting the final touches on everything, and because you’re\r\non this list, you’ll get first access to it once it goes live.\r\n\r\nI can promise you with full certainty that if you’re a complete\r\nbeginner who’s looking to build a copywriting business, this is\r\ngonna be the most valuable resource you have at your disposal.\r\n\r\nI’ll be giving you more info in the coming emails.\r\n\r\nFor now, go here and check out this video that’ll help you\r\ndevelop a magnetic aura and make other people love you.

    "body": "The other day, I sent you an email titled “HOW TO NOT BE A BOT.”\r\n\r\nIt’s the most important life hack you can understand.\r\n\r\nIt’ll get you clients, friends, perceived status, etc. Simply\r\nput, not being a bot makes you a winner.\r\n\r\nToday, I want to dive into the psychology behind this.\r\n\r\nIn college, there was a kid in my pledge class who we called a\r\nrobot.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of the story, I’ll call him Robo-Joe.\r\n\r\nRobo-Joe had one goal in life:\r\n\r\nGet with sorority girls.\r\n\r\nHe was decent-looking and our school was literally 70% female, so\r\nthe odds were stacked in his favor.\r\n\r\nBut there was a problem…\r\n\r\nHe had the charisma of a rock.\r\n\r\nJoe was the type of person that likely doesn’t have inner\r\ndialogue, but if he did I imagine it would sound as follows:\r\n\r\n“I want gorls. I go to school that 70% gorl. I join frat to seem\r\nnormal so I get mor gorl. I go gym to get big and strwong so gorl\r\nlike me.”\r\n\r\nBecause he was a robot, he took a very direct approach to the\r\nabove goal.\r\n\r\nHe thought that all of the things above would make him desirable.\r\n\r\nAnd while he did have some ‘success,’ Joes intentions became\r\nclear to anyone with half a brain.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t pledge a fraternity because he wanted to make genuine\r\nfriends; he did so to make it look like he had friends.\r\n\r\nHe was obsessed with the gym because, in his mind, it would make\r\nhim desirable to women.\r\n\r\nRobo-Joe tried to cover up his intentions by becoming your\r\ntypical jacked frat bro.\r\n\r\nAnd he wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, so it didn’t really\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFun fact: our wardens actually made him play brain games for 20\r\nminutes a day and report back with his progress because he was\r\nquite slow.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I’m telling you all about Robo-Joe because this is the\r\napproach most people take when they want something.\r\n\r\nLet’s say you want to get your first client and decide that\r\nyou’re just gonna spam DM a bunch of people without doing any\r\nresearch on who they are or what you should offer them.\r\n\r\nYou do that for 3 months, and it doesn’t work because you’re\r\nretarded so you quit.\r\n\r\nThat’s the direct Robo-Joe approach.\r\n\r\nLet’s talk about the better way to get what you want…\r\n\r\nThe first five info-product clients I got were all online\r\nbasketball trainers.\r\n\r\nI went 4/4 on outreach, and one of them (who had half a million\r\nfollowers) reached out to me first.\r\n\r\nSo, to make it clear, I sent four messages and got five clients,\r\nwhich is statistically impossible if you’re not named Ben Bader.\r\n\r\nThe reason this worked wasn’t because of my script or even any\r\ncrazy case study.\r\n\r\nIt was because of two things:\r\n\r\n* I existed on the internet. I was posting content about\r\nbasketball trainer marketing and running ads.\r\n* I used my brain to reach out at the right time. If they posted\r\na new offer or something that I thought I could help with on\r\ntheir story, that’s when I’d send a DM.\r\n\r\nActually, I guess I lied — the third element was that I was half\r\ndecent at writing copy and providing the other services I was\r\noffering, so I was confident in the way I spoke to them.\r\n\r\nThat’s the anti-robot approach. It might sound like it’ll take\r\nlonger, but it diminishes your need to get lucky by spam DM’ing a\r\nbunch of people.\r\n\r\nI don’t know if there was any saving Robo-Joe, but if he had put\r\nthe time into becoming someone who was desirable to women instead\r\nof trying shallow fixes to fake it, maybe he would’ve had a shot.\r\n\r\n​Anyway, I figured out the key to happiness and share it with you\r\nin this video.

It\r\nmakes time fly by, even when you’re completing a rather trivial\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nThe construction workers show up every day and do their best.\r\nThat's what makes it fun.\r\n\r\nSure, they have other goals, aspirations, and worries.\r\n\r\nBut for now, they are where they are.\r\n\r\nAnd you are where you are.\r\n\r\nAccepting that fact doesn’t mean you’re forgoing your hopes and\r\ndreams, as you don’t need to constantly create an internal Hell\r\nto continue progressing.\r\n\r\nYou perform best when you find a way to enjoy what you’re doing.\r\n\r\nBe here, do your best, and life goes from black and white to\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was supposed to be a launch email where I tell you\r\nabout my new partnership and offer for you.\r\n\r\nAs you can tell, I deviated from that plan, so I’ll just plug it\r\nhere quickly.\r\n\r\nIf you’re trying to build a copywriting business, become a\r\n‘growth operator,’ or build an agency, and you want my help…\r\n\r\n​Go here and I’ll give you all the details.

    "body": "I was sitting at lunch today with a couple of friends, and we\r\ntalked about what people do after college.\r\n\r\nAll three of us could think of a handful of people we knew in\r\nschool who are now just drifting.\r\n\r\nThey either moved back in with their parents or they’re working\r\nsome dead end job “figuring things out.”\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely asinine to me.\r\n\r\nWasn’t the point of college to find some direction and career\r\npath?\r\n\r\nMany of my friends who graduated about a year ago have reached\r\nout to me, expressing unhappiness about the situation it’s left\r\nthem in.\r\n\r\nThey’d spent the last four years (and hundreds of thousands of\r\ndollars) pretending like this day would never come.\r\n\r\nNow, it’s not like they’re doomed for life, but it’s definitely a\r\nhell of a lot harder.\r\n\r\nI’m not writing this to shame them but rather to warn you about\r\nwhat could happen if you try to ignore the inevitable destination\r\nthat it will lead you to.\r\n\r\nHow long will you lie to yourself and say you’ll make a change\r\n“one day?”\r\n\r\nThat day will never come if you don’t create it.\r\n\r\nIt starts by making the conscious decision to design your life in\r\na way that will steer you in a new direction.\r\n\r\nYour habits, thoughts, and beliefs must begin to change.\r\n\r\nThis is how you step into a new identity.\r\n\r\nThe worst place in life is in the middle, drifting between what\r\nyou want and what you have.\r\n\r\nIf your actions aren’t in alignment with the life you want to\r\ncreate, you’re in danger.\r\n\r\nYou can continue ignoring that feeling that tells you that you\r\nwant more, or you can decide to actually commit to building this\r\nnew reality.\r\n\r\nI know this sounds simple, but if you objectively audit what\r\nyou’re doing right now, and it isn’t propelling you to where you\r\nwant to be, you have a problem.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to ignore the problem, it will grow like a parasite\r\nin the back of your mind.\r\n\r\nEventually, you’ll be the unhappy 50-year-old with a life full of\r\n“what ifs.”\r\n\r\nStop drifting, my friend.\r\n\r\nLife is beautiful when you create it. I’m telling you firsthand\r\nthat the hardship that comes with change is worth the experiences\r\nand freedom it grants you access to.\r\n\r\nTake control of your life before it’s too late,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. If you want to build a copywriting business, I have an\r\nopportunity for you.\r\n\r\nYou may have seen that I recently partnered with my friend\r\nCardinal Mason inside of Copy MBA.\r\n\r\nIt’s his birthday tomorrow, and we’re running a $1,000 discount\r\nfor the next few days.\r\n\r\n​To get access to it, go here and apply now.

    "body": "When I moved to Miami almost two years ago, I was a very\r\ndifferent person.\r\n\r\nI was making around $15k-$20k per month, I had less confidence,\r\nand the move here was intimidating to me.\r\n\r\nThe last ~20 months have been transformational.\r\n\r\nMy income has increased by more than 5x, and my social circle has\r\nexpanded while I’ve developed tighter bonds with the few people\r\nI’d consider brothers.\r\n\r\nThe entire way I view myself has changed.\r\n\r\nI started doing many of the things that were on my “one-day”\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nMy personal brand has grown, I’ve picked up new hobbies, and my\r\nlifestyle is exactly the way I used to dream of.\r\n\r\nI’ve taken a series of actions that have created a ripple effect.\r\n\r\nWhen you do one thing that you’re a bit nervous to do, your brain\r\nrealizes that the fears you have around that thing are\r\nself-imagined.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling that you’ve placed on yourself starts to get removed.\r\n\r\nThis makes it easier to tackle the next thing you’re putting off,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nBut knocking down that first domino is always the hardest.\r\n\r\nRight now, you have beliefs that align with the person that you\r\nare in the present.\r\n\r\nTo do something new, those beliefs have to change – but they\r\nwon’t change by standing in the mirror and telling yourself\r\naffirmations, watching self-help YouTube videos, or meditating in\r\nfront of a Tony Robbins poster.\r\n\r\nYou must go out into the world and give yourself real data that\r\nan alternate identity is possible.\r\n\r\nObviously, I can sit here and tell you this over and over, but it\r\nwon’t mean shit to you until you actually put it into practice.\r\n\r\nThroughout my days as a basketball player, this was something I\r\nstruggled with.\r\n\r\nI was always in the gym, watching film, writing down goals, and\r\ndoing everything I could to make my hoop dreams come true.\r\n\r\nBut I was never fully able to step into that new reality and play\r\nto what I knew my true ability was in real games.\r\n\r\nIt’s almost like I was rewarding myself for all the preparation I\r\nwas doing rather than actually applying it where it mattered.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to rehearsing the “perfect” lines to say to a\r\ngirl at the bar, but when you get there, you stand in the corner\r\nrefreshing the weather app.\r\n\r\nOr you could do all the research possible about copywriting, read\r\nall the books, and buy courses, but never send a DM and try to\r\nget a client.\r\n\r\nPractice means nothing without action.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it’s better to be less prepared and dive in head first\r\nrather than sharpening your sword to never pull it out.\r\n\r\nDo the things that are difficult for you and watch your\r\nlimitations evaporate.\r\n\r\nI promise it’ll be worth it.\r\n\r\nTalk tomorrow,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Any fun weekend plans???\r\n\r\nHahaha.\r\n\r\nGrow up.\r\n\r\nIt’s such a beautiful day here that I feel bad for anyone who\r\nisn’t in the state of Florida.\r\n\r\nBesides those who are in Orlando. Or even worse… Tampa. Ew.\r\n\r\nImagine the highlight of your city being a predatory theme park\r\nor a place called “Meat Market.”\r\n\r\nAt least Tampa has “The Edition” - a 3.5-star hotel in any major\r\ncity, but seems to be the main attraction since there’s nothing\r\nelse to do there. They also only employ members of the LGBTDJKD\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nI’m not trying to be homophobic, but members of this community\r\ndon’t seem to have the best work ethic, so things tend to take\r\nlonger at this hotel. However, they are very good at making\r\nlattes.\r\n\r\nAnyway I’m sitting outside Starbucks, sipping on a cold brew with\r\nvanilla cream and sugar, and thinking about how much of a\r\nhypocrite I am.\r\n\r\nI just got jealous of a homeless man because he looked happy and\r\nhad really good posture.\r\n\r\nI can’t help but judge the man a couple tables away from me\r\nwearing a suit on his lunch break.\r\n\r\nI started off this email by making fun of those who look forward\r\nto Fridays and weekends, but I’d be lying if I said my mood isn’t\r\nslightly better on days like this.\r\n\r\nAnd if I actually followed the majority of the advice I give on\r\nthe internet, I’d be a billionaire by now.\r\n\r\nA wise man once said, “The most honest people are hypocrites.”\r\n\r\nThe wise man who said that is the same one who’s writing this\r\nemail.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re still reading by now you’re probably wondering\r\nwhere the lesson is or what I’m gonna “teach” you here.\r\n\r\nMy goal is not to teach but rather entertain.\r\n\r\nThe richest people are the entertainers. Think about Tate. His\r\nmessage wasn’t something that others hadn’t said prior.\r\n\r\nBut he blew up because the guy is just outrageous. The way he\r\nspeaks, the stories he tells, and the unapologetic expression of\r\nhis thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt was refreshing to see someone who genuinely seemed not to care\r\nif people didn’t agree with him while simultaneously saying what\r\neveryone else was thinking.\r\n\r\nOn another note, most of the successful people I know are really\r\nlazy when they’re uninterested.\r\n\r\nMyself included — I’ve always had a really hard time doing things\r\nI don’t want to do.\r\n\r\nI’ll wait until the final deadline, half-ass the project, cheat\r\noff the Asian kid, and do everything I can to get by while\r\nputting in minimal effort.\r\n\r\nBut when I’m bought in and find something that I’m interested in,\r\nI turn into an autistic computer engineer.\r\n\r\nI can spend hours at my desk without losing focus. It occupies my\r\nmind constantly.\r\n\r\nMaybe you’re the same.\r\n\r\nOne thing I’ve started to understand about this is that obsession\r\nis created, not found.\r\n\r\nYou don’t “stumble” upon something you’re passionate about.\r\n\r\nBut rather, you create that passion by diving into a project and\r\nlearning to love the mundane tasks that come with it.\r\n\r\nOk, I gotta hop on a call, but before I go, I’m feeling generous\r\ntoday, so I’m giving $100 to a random subscriber who watches and\r\ncomments on my recent YT video.\r\n\r\n​Go here and watch this video (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluew470l3hnh4v2mvvbph29lx000h6/7qh7h8hod5vd8waz/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9OWGFNYktTcDdLMA==\r\n) (leave a comment with your favorite thing I said in the video).\r\n\r\nConsidering my audience is still relatively small, you have like\r\na 1/10 chance of winning probably.\r\n\r\nBye love you,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "The money you want is right in front of you; you’re just looking\r\nin the wrong places.\r\n\r\nThis is something I think about often.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, I’ll hop on calls with people who are clearly\r\nsitting on a goldmine.\r\n\r\nMaybe they have an in-demand skill, a large audience that isn’t\r\nproperly monetized, or some other form of leverage they are not\r\naccessing.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside looking in, the right move is so clear to me.\r\n\r\nBut it’s almost like they’re wearing tinted glasses that are\r\nblocking them from making the obvious decision that could\r\ndrastically increase their income.\r\n\r\nIt’s like when you have a friend who gets into a relationship\r\nwith someone who clearly isn’t good for them.\r\n\r\nThey’re “drunk in love” and can’t see the red flags or problems\r\nassociated with the relationship.\r\n\r\nOnce the glasses are removed, their vision becomes clear, and the\r\nproblem vanishes.\r\n\r\nThis works the same way in business.\r\n\r\nPeople continuously look for the next shiny object, the next\r\nmove, or the alternative direction they could take.\r\n\r\nBut they refuse to look at what’s right in front of them.\r\n\r\nLet’s say you get a copywriting client who pays you $3k per month\r\nto run their email marketing.\r\n\r\nYou think to yourself, “Okay, this is great. Now I just need to\r\nget a few more clients, and I’ll be at $10k per month.”\r\n\r\nYou then spend the majority of your time trying to get more\r\nclients.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t go as planned, and the client you had dropped you\r\nafter a few months because they weren’t getting the desired\r\nresult from email.\r\n\r\nNow you’re back at square one.\r\n\r\nThe problem?\r\n\r\nYou were looking in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nHad you objectively assessed their business, you would’ve noticed\r\nthat their funnel needs work, their VSL is shit, and their sales\r\nteam isn’t following up with leads.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, your emails didn’t increase revenue because\r\nthere were other holes that needed to be patched.\r\n\r\nBut you weren’t focused on that.\r\n\r\nYou were spamming strangers on the internet, trying to get\r\nanother client.\r\n\r\nWhat if you had fixed the other gaps in your clients' business?\r\n\r\nLet's say you rewrite their VSL, build them a new funnel, and\r\nhelp the sales team manage their leads.\r\n\r\nBetween these changes and your email marketing efforts, the\r\nrevenue increases by 2 or 3x.\r\n\r\nAnd because you were the person who helped them make more money,\r\nthey’re happily giving you a percentage of the revenue.\r\n\r\nBoom - you just turned your $3k/month client into a $10k/month\r\nclient because you maximized the opportunity in front of you.\r\n\r\nHere’s the part where I shamelessly plug the Copy MBA Inner\r\nCircle (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/lmun5487w2hmh09dnlzi6hdow7000sg/3ohphkh7x504w3ur/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29weW1iYS5jb20vYmItaWMxP2VsPUJlbi1FbWFpbA==\r\n) and show you how Vagner is doing exactly what I described\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n​\r\nHe’s already made an extra $2k because of it.\r\n\r\nTo get access to the same information he has, a community of\r\nother copywriters, and direct coaching from me and the Copy MBA\r\nteam, go here now to learn more.

You allow for the possibility of greatness when you stop\r\ntrying to be perfect.\r\n\r\nThe other day, I woke up scrambling for an idea.\r\n\r\nI wanted to start my next Youtube video with narration and\r\nb-roll.\r\n\r\nAs I walked to Starbucks to get some shots and try to think of an\r\nidea, I realized it was right in front of me (watch the video for\r\ncontext) (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqhkvz065cvhp6eorrrho/z2hghnh35m263dhp/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9Kajd1VUVjdXYyZz9zaT1KV01HWjFtNnFmLVQxVnpM\r\n)​\r\n\r\nThe lesson:\r\n\r\nYour best work and most fruitful business ventures usually happen\r\nby accident.\r\n\r\nJust get the ball rolling, and things will work out.\r\n\r\nAs long as you’re aware and conscious of the opportunities that\r\nappear in front of you, you’ll stumble into greatness.\r\n\r\n2. Don’t let your fear of heightened standards stop you from\r\nstarting.\r\n\r\nThis is something I talk about often, as I’m frequently reminded\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nAs you progress in any endeavor, you add more pressure by\r\nrevealing to yourself what you are capable of.\r\n\r\nYou’re probably subconsciously aware of this now, and it could be\r\nthe reason that you’re putting off a goal.\r\n\r\nI’m reminded of this with each video I post. There's this voice\r\nin the back of my head that says, “What’s next? How are you gonna\r\ntop that?”\r\n\r\nIt’s a constant pressure that comes with a certain standard. But\r\nI can promise it’s far better than the anxiety that comes with\r\nsuppressing your desires.\r\n\r\n3. The best lessons are pulled from the trenches.\r\n\r\nAny time I take on a new endeavor, I’m able to see many\r\nsimilarities between each pursuit.\r\n\r\nI’ve learned more from things like boxing, lifestyle maxxing, and\r\nmaking content than I have from any coaching program or course.\r\n\r\nSide quests are often life's best teachers.\r\n\r\nAnd who knows, maybe you’ll learn a lesson or open a door that’ll\r\nhelp you financially as well.\r\n\r\nAnyway – here’s the link to my new Youtube video.

    "body": "“Attention is the new currency.”\r\n\r\nYou’ve likely heard this before.\r\n\r\nMake content, build an audience, and sell them something.\r\n\r\nIt’s one of the quickest ways people are getting rich.\r\n\r\nOver the last few years, it seems like the floodgates have been\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nEveryone and their Grandma are content creators.\r\n\r\nI can’t go to lunch without seeing people with hundreds of\r\nthousands of followers.\r\n\r\nIt literally seems like it’s one in every three people.\r\n\r\nThis is what has allowed me to build my agency.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, I work with people who have a big audience and\r\nsell information.\r\n\r\nWe write their copy, build their funnels, script their videos,\r\nand basically manage the entire backend for them, so all they\r\nhave to do is make more videos and get more attention.\r\n\r\nThe more eyeballs they get, the more money they make, which makes\r\nour services more valuable and they end up paying us more.\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest way I can explain my business's role in the\r\n“attention economy.”\r\n\r\nWe’re leveraging a vast skillset, time, and expertise to\r\ncapitalize on creators' existing audiences and help them make way\r\nmore money than they would without us.\r\n\r\nFor most of our clients, our work is relatively the same – we\r\nbuild the similar landing pages, write similar emails, and even\r\nthe VSL and webinar scripts are relatively templated.\r\n\r\nOn our end, there’s minimal difference in the workload between a\r\nclient who pays us $5k/month versus one who pays us $30k/month.\r\n\r\nThe singular variable is attention.\r\n\r\nWe recently started working with a guy who has a really solid\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nHe has multiple six-figure followers, good engagement, and his\r\ncontent is fire.\r\n\r\nFrom one post on Instagram and Tik Tok, he’s gotten the number of\r\nleads that we should be able to generate around a quarter million\r\ndollars from over the next week.\r\n\r\nFrom one post.\r\n\r\nLet me reiterate – the one difference between him and someone who\r\nmakes little money from info is the audience.\r\n\r\nSomeone else could have the same story, results, success,\r\nexpertise, etc.\r\n\r\nBut if they don’t have a loyal audience of people who know, like,\r\nand trust them on the internet, it means nothing.\r\n\r\nAttention is everything.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re trying to build your own coaching business or\r\nyou’re doing something similar to me.\r\n\r\nYour marketing efforts, systems, and positioning do not matter if\r\nno one is seeing it.\r\n\r\nSo if you’re a copywriter or “gRoWtH oPeraToR” keep this in mind\r\nwhen trying to get clients.\r\n\r\nTo get a killer case study, you need a killer client – a pig with\r\nlipstick on is still a pig. lol.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I’ve been having a ton of fun working with the students\r\ninside the Copy MBA Inner Circle, and it’s dope to see them\r\ngetting results from it.\r\n\r\n​If you wanna make money as a copywriter or growth operator you\r\nshould go here and apply so I can make you rich ok?

Early in the first\r\nquarter, he hit two open shots in a row, and from that point on,\r\nhe’s been lighting it up.\r\n\r\nThis is something you’ll commonly see amongst the best scorers in\r\nbasketball.\r\n\r\nIf they get an easy shot early on, this will help them get into a\r\nrhythm, and it’s going to be a long night for the defense.\r\n\r\nThis “easy bucket method” is something I use almost every day\r\n(off the basketball court).\r\n\r\nWhen I sit down to work, most of my tasks each day fall into one\r\nof two categories:\r\n\r\n1. Easy to complete, low time commitment\r\n\r\nOr…\r\n\r\n2. Difficult to complete, higher time commitment\r\n\r\nI almost always start with one of the easier, lower-friction\r\nactions, and once I knock a few of those out, I build momentum –\r\nWhich makes it much easier to move on to the more time-intensive\r\nstuff.\r\n\r\nThis is one of my best “productivity hacks,” and I use it\r\nwhenever I am trying to achieve a bigger goal.\r\n\r\nVery simple concept, but try it out next time you find yourself\r\nprocrastinating.\r\n\r\nAnyway, check out my recent video if you haven’t already 👇\r\n\r\n​ (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92ung4ow87hnhqv60koc9h0vqr333bw/owhkhqhrpk7kdeuv/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS83a2ZicFdYTUtCOA==\r\n)I have $100 for a random subscriber who leaves a comment about\r\ntheir favorite part of the vid :)\r\n\r\nNight bo,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/92ung4ow87hnhqv60koc9h0vqr333bw\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/92ung4ow87hnhqv60koc9h0vqr333bw\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92ung4ow87hnhqv60koc9h0vqr333bw/z2hghnh3n484xgip/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

Or maybe\r\nyou don’t fully respect yourself because you’ve found success\r\nthrough nefarious means.\r\n\r\nBecause of these factors, you aren’t the type of person that\r\nother amazing, genuine people want to be around.\r\n\r\nYou end up attracting shallow people into your life – guys who\r\nwould slander your name if it’s in their best interest and a girl\r\nwho would leave your table at the club to go to Futures table\r\n(rip).\r\n\r\nYou see a lot of these types in Miami and they’re usually dripped\r\nout in Chrome Hearts.\r\n\r\nThese are people who “beat the system.”\r\n\r\nThey found the financial success that others dream of, perhaps\r\nwithout having to go through the usual hardship or personal\r\ndevelopment process.\r\n\r\nBut they don’t get to fully enjoy the money because they haven’t\r\nbecome the person who is worthy of incredible relationships, as\r\nyou attract what you are.\r\n\r\nAnd even if you “earn” all the money in the world, you still have\r\nto earn your relationships.\r\n\r\nLaying on the beach in Barbados means nothing if you aren’t with\r\npeople you love.\r\n\r\nDriving your dream car through the Hollywood hills doesn’t hit\r\nthe same if the girl in your passenger seat only likes you for\r\nyour money.\r\n\r\nOpening your banking app to a number that would allow you to\r\nretire at any moment feels empty when you don’t like the person\r\nwhose face you see in the reflection of your screen.\r\n\r\nYour relationships are everything and there are no shortcuts that\r\nwill earn you respect.\r\n\r\nSo if you’re in the trenches right now and you feel like you’re\r\nnot reaping the rewards of your efforts…\r\n\r\nCongratulations. You’re in the process of developing into the\r\nperson who is worthy of the reality that you want.\r\n\r\nSorry for the hiatus. Good to be back,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

I'm seated slightly\r\nbehind him so he wouldn’t see me coming.\r\n\r\nPlus he can’t be more than 140 pounds and one right hook to the\r\ntemple should knock him out.\r\n\r\nDamnit. no weapon, just airpods.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment I sat down he’s been talking abnormally loud.\r\n\r\nMost of which has been mumble nonsense but at one point he asked\r\nthe man in the floral shirt at the table in front of him if he\r\ncould come sit with him.\r\n\r\nThe man politely declined.\r\n\r\nHe just took a final sip out of each of his three bottles and is\r\nnow flailing his arms above his head.\r\n\r\nSmoke break. He put a cigarette in his mouth and walked outside.\r\n\r\nThis is fun. It's usually only homeless people that you get to\r\nsee have outbursts like this.\r\n\r\nOther than a few staff members, no one else in the restaurant has\r\neven noticed him.\r\n\r\nEveryone is just in their own little bubble, dealing with their\r\nown ambitions, obstacles, and problems.\r\n\r\nI guess if there’s a lesson here it’s that letting the opinions\r\nof others stop you from doing something you want is so silly.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you’re gonna die one day.\r\n\r\nSecond of all, who cares what they think.\r\n\r\nAnd third, they’re probably not even gonna notice you.\r\n\r\nOur friend is back from his smoke break.\r\n\r\nHe asked for another beer and the waiter reluctantly told him\r\nthat they aren’t legally allowed to serve more than three\r\nalcoholic beverages.\r\n\r\nI wonder if that’s true or if he was just worried that this guy\r\nwas gonna start dancing on the table.\r\n\r\nInstead the waiter went and got him some water. The manic man got\r\nup and gave him a hug.\r\n\r\nHe drunkenly said, “Thank you. I’ve had such a rough day,”\r\ngrabbed his things and walked out with hope in his stride.\r\n\r\nAw. What a nice happy ending.\r\n\r\nI guess everyone’s dealing with their own shit and it's not good\r\nfor us to judge.\r\n\r\nAnyway – This video is one of my favorites and it’s something\r\nthat helped me go from being a normal college kid to building my\r\ndream life over the last 4 years.

A lot.\r\n\r\nAnd it bought him a Bugatti.\r\n\r\nFuck. I want a Bugatti.\r\n\r\nLet’s do more of the basics and have a great week,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "There are two types of people in this world.\r\n\r\nThe first type of person is the one who hesitates to start a\r\nbusiness because they’re worried about how they’d pay taxes if\r\nthey were to make money.\r\n\r\nThey sit there and think about every possible problem that they\r\ncould possibly run into.\r\n\r\n“What happens if I get a client and then they ask me to do\r\nsomething that I don’t know how to do?”\r\n\r\nThese are the types that want a “full step-by-step playbook” to\r\nstart a business.\r\n\r\nIt’s like they’re taking the 9-5er approach to business and need\r\nto be told what to do every step of the way.\r\n\r\nThere’s an acronym that accurately describes this type:\r\n\r\nNGMI (not gonna make it).\r\n\r\nThey’re effectively toddlers.\r\n\r\nThe second type of person is the one who adopts a different\r\nmindset.\r\n\r\nSure, they still have hesitations, fears and doubts.\r\n\r\nAnd they don’t know what every step of the staircase will look\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nBut they take action despite these factors.\r\n\r\nThere’s a different acronym that they follow:\r\n\r\nFITFO (figure it the fuck out).\r\n\r\nYesterday I found a perfect example of these two people in the\r\ncomment section of one of my Youtube videos.\r\n\r\nOne person commented “This video is ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY\r\nPOINTLESS” and right underneath him was a comment that read:\r\n\r\n“Exactly what I’m going through rn. Your YouTube was really put\r\nin my life for a reason. The timing of this video is impeccable”\r\n\r\nCan you guess who’s who in this example?\r\n\r\nSure I’m biased because it’s my own video but this was\r\ninteresting to me.\r\n\r\nHow can two people watch the same exact video and have completely\r\nopposite reactions?\r\n\r\nPerception.\r\n\r\nYour reality is colored by the lens in which you view the world.\r\n\r\nIf you think someone is coming to save you, or you think there’s\r\na step by step system that everyone who “makes it” follows, you\r\nwill find information that lacks training wheels useless.\r\n\r\nInstead you’ll watch hyper edited videos that follow a script and\r\nhave gay animations over them.\r\n\r\nYou’ll get a dopamine rush and think you’re doing something\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nBut you’ll never actually find success because you’re type one.\r\n\r\nYou need everything to be predictable – which is the opposite of\r\nentrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, if you understand that anything worth having\r\ntakes time and that your reality lies on your shoulders alone,\r\nyou will eventually achieve your desired result.\r\n\r\nAnd when you consume information that reminds you of this,\r\ninstead of getting angry that you weren’t handed an “A-Z\r\nblueprint” you’ll feel inspired that others see the world the\r\nsame way you do.\r\n\r\nEvery day you have the power to choose which of these two people\r\nyou want to be.\r\n\r\nOne will serve you and push you towards your goals.\r\n\r\nAnd the other will keep you stuck in the same mindset that has\r\ngotten you nowhere.\r\n\r\nChoose wisely.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "Happy Saturday bo,\r\n\r\nIt’s been rainy and gloomy here in Miami for the past few days.\r\n\r\nThe sky is white right now but there’s no rain coming down so I’m\r\nsitting on my balcony as I write this to you.\r\n\r\nOver the last few days I’ve really noticed how the weather\r\nimpacts my mood.\r\n\r\nI’m a firm believer that 99% of problems can be fixed with a long\r\nwalk in the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen it was constantly raining and I was unable to do so, I\r\nstarted to go crazy.\r\n\r\nAnyway it’s unusually quiet for a Saturday in the middle of\r\nBrickell.\r\n\r\nUsually there's this dude who bikes around carrying a beat box.\r\n\r\nHe’ll stop on random street corners and start break dancing.\r\n\r\nImagine you’re hungover at 8am on a Saturday and you’re woken up\r\nby a Bad Bunny song.\r\n\r\nYou get up, walk out onto your balcony and see some guy with pink\r\nhair and the shape of a heart on the back of his head.\r\n\r\nHe's blasting music and dancing like a freak.\r\n\r\nYou’d probably try to snipe him right?\r\n\r\nI tried once but hit an old lady by accident.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone finally got him because it’s quiet today.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the other day I hosted a group call inside of Copy MBA.\r\n\r\nSomeone asked a question about “writers block” when first\r\nstarting out.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to build a copywriting business and you’re\r\ntrying to practice, or you just want to start writing in general,\r\nthis is inevitable.\r\n\r\nThis student was trying to write a sample email for this\r\nsupplement brand, but whenever he opens a google doc, he stares\r\nat a blinking cursor and eventually closes his laptop.\r\n\r\nHappens.\r\n\r\nI asked him what sport he played growing up.\r\n\r\nHe told me he does mixed martial arts so I recommended that he\r\nfind someone who is selling MMA courses or pick a clothing brand\r\nin that space and write for that instead.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is effective is because it’s much easier to write\r\nabout things you’d be in the market for.\r\n\r\nEspecially when you’re first starting out.\r\n\r\nWhen I started, I was writing copy for basketball trainers.\r\n\r\nIn every email, every ad, and every funnel I built – I was\r\nwriting to my previous self.\r\n\r\nI understood the pain points and desires of the market because I\r\nwas the market.\r\n\r\nAnd this made practicing 100x easier.\r\n\r\nBetween this and building the habit of writing every day, I got\r\nbetter quickly.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get better at copy, you need to write for fun.\r\n\r\nStart journaling.\r\n\r\nStart tweeting.\r\n\r\nWrite a love letter to your ex.\r\n\r\nGo sit down in a coffee shop and write about the barista that\r\nheld eye contact for too long when taking your order.\r\n\r\nWrite about the idiot who’s standing in the middle of the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\nWrite about the poor bastard who passes by on a scooter in work\r\nclothes with a backpack on.\r\n\r\nDescribe what you see in detail.\r\n\r\nMake it entertaining and don’t hold back\r\n\r\nJust write.\r\n\r\nIt will make your life better. And eventually, you’ll be half\r\ndecent at it.\r\n\r\nAlrighty I’m going to the gym.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you liked this one,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Pitches in every digital inbox I own.\r\n\r\nInstagram, Twitter, TikTok, Gmail, even Venmo…\r\n\r\nPeople on the internet are constantly trying to get me to buy\r\ntheir services through cold outreach.\r\n\r\nAnd my audience isn’t even that big.\r\n\r\n99% of the outbound messages I read are absolute trash.\r\n\r\nWith every word they are showing more incompetence and only\r\nproving to be someone who I don’t want to work with.\r\n\r\nThey barely do any research on me or what I could potentially\r\nneed, their messages are too long, they sound retarded, etc.\r\n\r\nBut honestly, it’s not their fault.\r\n\r\nOutreach USED to be a numbers game.\r\n\r\nIf you blindly send enough cold DM’s, eventually you’ll get a\r\nclient.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t work like that anymore (especially if you want to get\r\nGOOD clients that will pay you a decent retainer).\r\n\r\nYour success is now correlated to the quality of your message and\r\nthe way you are perceived online.\r\n\r\nYes, volume still matters.\r\n\r\nBut failing to put yourself in a more credible position before\r\ndoing outreach is like DMing Instagram models when you have 29\r\nfollowers and one picture of yourself holding a fish.\r\n\r\nNot gonna work.\r\n\r\nThere are three things you can do that will improve your online\r\nperception, thus increasing the likelihood you get replies to\r\nyour cold pitches.\r\n\r\n1. Post content\r\n\r\n2. Lead with material that proves competence\r\n\r\n3. Network\r\n\r\nThe first point (content) is self explanatory.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a beginner I understand that it may be difficult to\r\nknow where to start in that regard.\r\n\r\nBut I’m not just talking about video content or even posting\r\ninformation related to what you’re pitching.\r\n\r\nIf you look like a normal, cool person on Instagram, you will get\r\nmore responses.\r\n\r\nSimple.\r\n\r\nThis second element (material that proves competence) is\r\nabsolutely crucial as well.\r\n\r\nI get pitches with shitty sample emails and clips from my videos.\r\n\r\nThe time put into these assets is meaningless if they suck.\r\n\r\nIf they don’t suck, they get a reply.\r\n\r\nLast element – network (without being a dork).\r\n\r\nEveryone is more likely to respond to someone they have mutuals\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nStrangers don’t get replies. They stay poor for eternity.\r\n\r\nFriends do business together.\r\n\r\nGot it?\r\n\r\nStop spraying and praying.\r\n\r\nUse the three principles of online credibility above, and your\r\nchances of landing clients will greatly increase (and now it\r\nbecomes a numbers game).\r\n\r\nHope this helps – go show some love on this new video if it did\r\n:) (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403seh5ddxdehxh30rvv77t5/dpheh0h0vpe3qzfm/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9SUndzSU9LMkpIQT9zaT1ydEZfXzhoVnB2RjlFY2t3\r\n)​\r\n\r\nPlease stop pitching me,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403seh5ddxdehxh30rvv77t5\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403seh5ddxdehxh30rvv77t5\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403seh5ddxdehxh30rvv77t5/e0hph7h06r7xkpt8/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

Learn high income skills\r\n\r\n2. Use social media to build a network\r\n\r\n3. Build a personal brand\r\n\r\nThose three assets turn you into a weapon.\r\n\r\nThe first step (learning skills) is simple.\r\n\r\nSimply learn copywriting and sales and you’re in better shape\r\nthan 99% of people.\r\n\r\nWatch Youtube videos, pitch strangers on the internet, learn more\r\non the fly.\r\n\r\nStep two (building a network by being a normal cool person) opens\r\ndoors and gives you a safety net.\r\n\r\nIf you can just start to connect with more people who are on a\r\nsimilar path as you (or ahead of you) opportunities flow your\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe best way I’ve found to do this has been through Twitter and\r\nby joining mastermind and coaching programs.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, step three (personal brand) is perhaps the most\r\nvaluable resource you can build in 2024.\r\n\r\nNow, not everyone is meant to have tens or hundreds of thousands\r\nof followers.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn’t mean that you can’t share some insights on\r\nsocial media and utilize the platform.\r\n\r\nThis goes hand and hand with networking in step two.\r\n\r\nEven if you don’t end up building a huge personal brand, posting\r\ncontent online can only help you.\r\n\r\nAll three of these things will give you security and the best\r\nsafety net possible if things ever go south.\r\n\r\nIt’s the peace of mind that a college degree is supposed to give\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you liked this one :)\r\n\r\nBtw I have something really cool for you launching this week and\r\nI’m excited to share it with you.\r\n\r\nTalk soon,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/zluew470l3hnh42g82ptph298nn00u6\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/zluew470l3hnh42g82ptph298nn00u6\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluew470l3hnh42g82ptph298nn00u6/kkhmh6hlwd94w2ul/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

Swishes only.”\r\n\r\nI think to myself “this mf crazy, I need a new trainer.”\r\n\r\nBut I keep shooting, now aiming only for nylon.\r\n\r\nThe ball hits the back of the rim and goes in. Doesn’t count.\r\n\r\nFront rim. Side rim. Rattles in off the glass.\r\n\r\nDoesn’t matter, I’m running.\r\n\r\n“This is ridiculous. I’m literally making these shots and still\r\nbeing forced to run,” I complain to myself.\r\n\r\nBut then something cool happens.\r\n\r\nI find the sweet spot and the ball stops hitting the rim.\r\n\r\nThe way I’m shooting feels different now.\r\n\r\nI’m no longer just aiming for the basket.\r\n\r\nI’m aiming for a very specific part of the back of the net.\r\n\r\nI’m conscious of exactly how the ball has to leave my fingertips.\r\n\r\nEverything is incredibly precise.\r\n\r\nI’ve reached a level of attention to detail and focus that I\r\nwasn’t accessing previously.\r\n\r\nThis is the difference between good and great.\r\n\r\nIt’s what keeps some business owners stuck at $10k, $50k, or\r\n$100k per month.\r\n\r\nIt’s what causes tens of thousands of dollars worth of leads to\r\nfall through the cracks in a sales process.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s what created the opportunity for me to make 7 figures as\r\na marketer for info-product businesses.\r\n\r\nI get paid to fill in the gaps.\r\n\r\nTo improve the copy, or the sales process, or the video script.\r\n\r\nI bring a new level of attention to minor details and make an\r\nextra 6 figures a month for my clients.\r\n\r\nThey pay me a percentage of it.\r\n\r\nThis is how you win as a service provider for coaching business.\r\n\r\nFind the broken piece(s) of their business.\r\n\r\nIdentify a solution using your critical thinking ability.\r\n\r\nGet paid.\r\n\r\nFor example if an usually low amount of leads end up on sales\r\ncalls, my job is to find the crack in the system.\r\n\r\nMaybe the email sequence sucks or there’s none at all.\r\n\r\nMaybe the leads aren’t getting dialed.\r\n\r\nMaybe the video sales letter is horrible.\r\n\r\nMaybe there’s a lack of congruence between the content and the\r\nmessaging on the funnel.\r\n\r\nWhatever the problem is, the way to make money is to identify and\r\nfix it.\r\n\r\nBoom, now you’re a valuable piece to any coaching business.\r\n\r\nYou’re turning good, into great.\r\n\r\n​Congrats, that’s how the money is made.

Think about it.

I’m looking to\r\ntell them with some style, originality, and creativity.” -\r\nAnthony Bourdain\r\n\r\nHappy Saturday bo.\r\n\r\nThe other day I was on a 90-foot yacht for the 4th of July,\r\nhaving a brief conversation with a friend about YouTube.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, he had 27k subscribers but wasn’t making any\r\nmoney from his channel.\r\n\r\nThen he got a piece of advice that changed his life forever.\r\n\r\nIn passing, one of the biggest YouTubers in the world told him to\r\nchange the thumbnail on a video he’d posted 6 months prior.\r\n\r\nSo, he paid someone $10 to take a new thumbnail photo and\r\nuploaded it.\r\n\r\nOver the following 24 hours he went from 27k subs to over 100k\r\nand quit his job at Subway.\r\n\r\nHe eventually reached over 1m subscribers before his channel was\r\nbanned by the platform (you might know who I’m talking about here\r\nlol).\r\n\r\nWhat’s crazy to me is that all happened because of one small\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\nHere’s how this pertains to you:\r\n\r\nA single decision can completely change your life.\r\n\r\nIt could be a seemingly miniscule decision that you don’t give\r\nmuch thought to.\r\n\r\nIt could be a risk or hail mary attempt that leads to a big\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\nOr it could be the decision to power through a tough time and\r\nchange a behavior.\r\n\r\nGenuinely, sit there and think about this for a second.\r\n\r\nYou are one decision away from everything you could ever dream\r\nof.\r\n\r\nRight now, you don’t know what that decision is.\r\n\r\nOdds are, you won’t know the ripple effect that it’ll create even\r\nwhen you make it.\r\n\r\nBut if you keep throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping that it\r\nsticks, eventually it will.\r\n\r\nMaybe you’ll have to get creative and change from spaghetti to\r\npenne, or marinara to alfredo.\r\n\r\nMaybe Anthony Bourdain will descend from heaven and casually tell\r\nyou to add a single ingredient that makes it stick.\r\n\r\nOr maybe you just have to keep throwing it over and over, past\r\nthe point that you would usually quit.\r\n\r\nOne day, it will stick.\r\n\r\nThe culmination of all of your formerly unrewarded effort will be\r\npaid back 10 fold in an instant.\r\n\r\nTo others, you’ll appear to be an overnight success.\r\n\r\nBut you’ll know that’s not the case.\r\n\r\nIt was a result of tens, hundreds, or thousands of decisions and\r\nrepetitions…\r\n\r\nPlus a disdain for the run of the mill, competent effort.\r\n\r\nEventually, it works.\r\n\r\nKeep firing, and test the occasional aberrant idea.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "I have a superpower.\r\n\r\nIt's a singular strength I’ve really developed over the last few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt’s helped me in my personal life, business, and social media.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have made me more likable and has played a role in\r\nclient acquisition and results.\r\n\r\nMeaning it’s the reason people buy things.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s probably the same reason you like my content (unless you\r\nhate it and you’re just here to talk shit in my replies).\r\n\r\nThe cool thing about this superpower, is it’s something you have\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nMaybe you’re accessing it right now, maybe you’re not.\r\n\r\nBut I think it’s one of the key factors in finding success in all\r\nthe above domains.\r\n\r\n“Ok Ben, I get it, this thing is important. Now would you tell me\r\nwhat it is???”\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nDon’t you understand?\r\n\r\nRight now, you’re either using your superpower or you’re not.\r\n\r\nYou’re either hearing me, or you’re not.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s the secret.\r\n\r\nMy superpower is I listen.\r\n\r\nI listen to others when they talk. Not just what they say, but\r\nwhat they mean.\r\n\r\nWhen my girl says “it’s fine” I know that’s code for “you fucked\r\nup but I’m not telling you what you did, so you have to figure it\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nWhen a prospect tells me about their business, I put myself in\r\ntheir shoes.\r\n\r\nI think about their motives, desires and roadblocks.\r\n\r\nAnd I assess their situation as objectively as I can.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously a huge part of copywriting and sales. It’s\r\nhaving the empathy to prescribe the right solution to a certain\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nAnd if you don’t listen, you won’t be in tune with the problem.\r\n\r\nFurthermore I listen to myself.\r\n\r\nWhat do I actually want?\r\n\r\nWhy am I doing or not doing a certain thing?\r\n\r\nAre my actions in alignment with what I say I want? And if not,\r\nam I willing to change?\r\n\r\nI honestly think my habit to intellectualize my life is a\r\nblessing and curse.\r\n\r\nIt keeps me quite in touch with the underlying narratives going\r\nthrough my head.\r\n\r\nWhich helps me create content that feels really personal.\r\n\r\nIf it’s ever felt like I’m articulating an exact problem you\r\nhave, and the way you think about it, this is why.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes it also stops me from taking action as quickly as I\r\nshould.\r\n\r\nTwo sides to every coin I guess.\r\n\r\nAnyway - listen more.\r\n\r\nStop jumping to conclusions.\r\n\r\nGet off your high horse.\r\n\r\nAnd do your best to be empathetic. Both with others and with\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nRemember - you’re one decision away from turning everything\r\naround.

    "body": "Yo bo,\r\n\r\nLet’s talk about data.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I hate numbers.\r\n\r\nI cheated in every math class I ever took.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes only data can reveal a clear answer when things are\r\nstagnant or you’re not getting a result you want.\r\n\r\nThis can be quite obvious when looking at quantifiable data.\r\n\r\nIf you’re spending $10k on ads and only making $5k back, clearly\r\nthere's an issue.\r\n\r\nAny reasonable person who doesn’t want to lose money would then\r\ntry to figure out the problem.\r\n\r\nTo do this, they’d look at the more granular data.\r\n\r\nThe click through rate, cost per click, cost per impressions,\r\nconversion rate, etc.\r\n\r\nUsing this data, they’d attempt to identify the problem and test\r\na solution.\r\n\r\nRinse and repeat.\r\n\r\nThis is a pragmatic, data-driven approach that will result in\r\nobjective truths.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re not progressing in a certain area of your life the\r\nway you want to, this is what you need to apply.\r\n\r\nLet’s say you’ve been trying to put on muscle for 6 months.\r\n\r\nYour approach hasn’t been very meticulous and you stepped on the\r\nscale today and saw that you’ve only gained 2 pounds.\r\n\r\nAs a sensible person, capable of critical thought, what would you\r\ndo in this scenario?\r\n\r\nAnswer in your head real quick.\r\n\r\nIf you said something along the lines of “I’d audit what I’m\r\neating and how I’m working out, and see what needs to be\r\nchanged,” you’ve come up with a solid answer.\r\n\r\nNow for whatever reason, this ability to analyze data gets\r\nforgotten when the data is less quantifiable.\r\n\r\nMeaning if you’ve been in a situation you don’t like for an\r\nextended period of time.\r\n\r\nWhether it’s:\r\n\r\nTrying to start a business and not making much progress\r\n\r\nStagnating in your business\r\n\r\nLack of growth on social media\r\n\r\nOr even in your personal life:\r\n\r\nMaybe you’ve been wanting to improve a relationship, you’ve had a\r\nlist of hobbies that you wanted to try but haven’t, or you want\r\nto build better habits…\r\n\r\nWhatever that thing is, you eventually need to take an objective\r\nlook under the hood.\r\n\r\n“Why am I not solving this problem I have? What are the variables\r\nthat go into the problem? If I were to solve this problem, what\r\nwould need to change?”\r\n\r\nAnd just like that, you’ve given yourself action steps to execute\r\non.\r\n\r\nDon’t forget to look at the data in your life and perform\r\nmini-audits.\r\n\r\nBe pragmatic, and find the objective truth.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. I finished recording the last few modules of the Artisan Lab\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nIt has basically become a digital version of my brain.\r\n\r\nHere’s some of the info inside:\r\n\r\n* How I’ve built my agency to 6 figures/month\r\n* How we’ve scaled info businesses to $500k/month+\r\n* My full copywriting guide I’ve used to generate millions\r\n* The daily habits & routine that took me from being an average\r\ncollege kid to successful entrepreneur\r\n\r\nPlus a lot more.\r\n\r\nThinking about launching it in the next couple days.

    "body": "bo,\r\n\r\nTomorrow I'm launching my new mastermind, The Artisan Lab.\r\n\r\nIt will be centered around the 3 pillars that play the biggest\r\nrole in your success in online business.\r\n\r\nWhether you're just starting out, or you're a copywriter, growth\r\noperator, course seller, or you're building a different business\r\nentirely...\r\n\r\nThese three pillars dictate your success:\r\n\r\n1: Self\r\n\r\nSimply put, change starts in the mind.\r\n\r\nTo do something you haven't done before, you need to step into a\r\nnew identity.\r\n\r\nThis requires you to build new habits and discard old beliefs\r\nthat don't serve you.\r\n\r\n2: Skillset\r\n\r\nSkills give you the security that a college degree was supposed\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThis is what makes you valuable -- if you can write copy and you\r\ncan sell, it's nearly impossible for you to lose.\r\n\r\n3: Social\r\n\r\nConnections are everything and social media has made it easier\r\nthan ever to build a network.\r\n\r\nUse the internet to connect with likeminded people and\r\nopportunities will fall into your lap.\r\n\r\nIf you neglect any of the three pillars above, it's gonna take\r\nyou a lot longer to reach goals and increase your income.\r\n\r\nThat's why the Artisan Lab will focus on all three of these.\r\n\r\nObviously, you'll learn all about how I've scaled my agency to\r\n$100k/month...\r\n\r\nYou'll see inside our service delivery process and what we do to\r\nscale info products to $500k/month+.\r\n\r\nYou'll get my processes for creating content and growing your\r\npersonal brand on social media.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, you'll get my full systems for building webinars,\r\nwriting copy, VSLs, etc.\r\n\r\nBut none of that will matter if your mindset is flawed or you\r\ncan't build relationships with the right people.\r\n\r\nThe Artisan Lab will equip you with all of the necessary tools\r\nand attributes.\r\n\r\nIt's your unfair advantage.\r\n\r\nYou'll get 1 on 1 access to me, a private network and active\r\ncommunity, multiple calls per week, and information you can't\r\nfind elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnd because you're on my email list, you get access tomorrow\r\nbefore anyone else.\r\n\r\nWhich means you can be one of the first 20 founding members, who\r\nwill get a bonus 1 on 1 call with me plus a $1,000 discount.\r\n\r\nGoing live tomorrow. Keep an eye out for my next email and I'll\r\nsee you on the inside :)\r\n\r\nTalk soon,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hvrkqe3b6hrdd8l44un\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hvrkqe3b6hrdd8l44un\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205\r\n\r\n(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hvrkqe3b6hrdd8l44un/l2hehmh32q8kdvt6/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmc_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXBvd2VyZWRieSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPXJlZmVycmFsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9ZHluYW1pYw==\r\n)",

I honestly don’t care if he closes or not.\r\n\r\nBut it’d be really cool if I could flex on all of you who’ve been\r\ndoing outreach for a while.\r\n\r\nImagine you’re working your ass off sending 30 pitches a day.\r\n\r\nAnd then you see me, scrolling through tik tok in my pajamas when\r\nI find your ideal client.\r\n\r\nI open my laptop, click the loom button and start rambling about\r\nhow we’ve made a lot of clients a lot of moneys.\r\n\r\nNext thing you know I’m on a call with your ideal client and he\r\nloves me.\r\n\r\nWe talk about the weather and he tells me about his favorite\r\nspots in Miami when he was my age.\r\n\r\nI show him the keys to my Porsche 911 turbo and then tell him I\r\ncan help him make the equivalent of 3 of them in a month.\r\n\r\nHe’s wowed.\r\n\r\nI pitch a price 100x the average growth operator or copywriters\r\nnet worth.\r\n\r\nHe says “YES!!!” and asks if he can add a tip.\r\n\r\nI receive the wire on the call, my team builds him a new funnel,\r\nand we make him $1m next month.\r\n\r\nHahahaha.\r\n\r\nThat would be cool.\r\n\r\nI shared this whole outbound process (including the loom and\r\nemail I sent) inside the Artisan Lab btw.

    "body": "A lot has changed since the last email I sent to you.\r\n\r\nFirst, I moved.\r\n\r\nHere’s my new POV as I begin writing to you:\r\n\r\n​\r\nI’m now 80 something floors up with the water view you see above.\r\n\r\nIt’s much more peaceful than being in the middle of the city (and\r\nbetter than being on a poverty floor under the clouds).\r\n\r\nI was reminded of a very valuable lesson during this move.\r\n\r\nYou see, I’m the type of guy that does everything last minute.\r\n\r\nESPECIALLY if it’s something trivial or a task I don’t want to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nSo I waited until 6pm on the day before I was supposed to move to\r\nstart clicking around on the internet to find a moving company.\r\n\r\nI filled out a few forms to get quotes and assumed they’d reach\r\nout within a day or two.\r\n\r\nNext thing you know, I get a call from a local number.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, it’s Sunday at 7:24pm EST, less than an hour after\r\nI filled out the form.\r\n\r\nSome kind woman is on the other end with the moving company and\r\nshe tells me she can send movers as early as tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI’m sold.\r\n\r\nI don’t care about the price.\r\n\r\nI don’t care to get quotes from other companies.\r\n\r\nI had a problem and this woman Kathy (not her real name but she\r\nsounded like a Kathy) extinguished that problem quickly.\r\n\r\nThat’s the lesson.\r\n\r\nIf you’re selling agency services or coaching, or literally\r\nanything…\r\n\r\nMOVE FASTER.\r\n\r\nI’ve personally lost deals because I was too slow or wasn’t\r\n“available” until a few days later.\r\n\r\nBy then the urgency is gone.\r\n\r\nAnd the pain that comes with a fresh problem is diminished,\r\nmeaning getting the sale is gonna be harder.\r\n\r\nThis is why it’s a good rule of thumb to have a sales team that\r\ndials every lead immediately (if you run a coaching business and\r\nyou’re not doing this, that means you enjoy poverty).\r\n\r\nOne of the first lessons I was taught when I started running ads\r\nfor local basketball trainers 4 years ago, was “speed = lead.”\r\n\r\nI was in this coaching program and my coach told me to drill this\r\nmessage into the heads of my clients.\r\n\r\nMy job was to get them leads, but if they don’t contact those\r\nleads ASAP, then they’re throwing money down a furnace.\r\n\r\nAs you know, business is just a game of solving problems.\r\n\r\nThe bigger problems you solve and the faster you can do so, the\r\nmore money you make.\r\n\r\nThe first moving company that called me late on a Sunday got my\r\nbusiness and charged me $1,200 to move me 5 minutes down the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nMaybe there was a cheaper option.\r\n\r\nBut the problem was resolved and I’m happy to pay a premium for\r\nthe efficiency.\r\n\r\n​Don’t be slow or you’ll get left behind.

Talk about what you find interesting. Talk about why\r\nyou’re poor. Talk about your dog, or your girl, or your obsession\r\nwith sports betting.\r\n\r\nJust don’t say the N word or call fat people disgusting hippos.\r\n\r\nYou’ll be glad you started.\r\n\r\n​Get access to the next guest speaker call by going here.

I documented this whole process inside my mastermind.\r\n\r\nFrom what I said in the pitch, to the sales call, to the\r\nproposal, follow ups, and the contract that got the deal done.\r\n\r\nI’ll also be showing exactly what we do to scale this client to\r\nmulti six figures a month inside the Artisan Lab.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see that, plus get direct access to me, learn from\r\nnew guest speakers weekly, and be in a community of winners…\r\n\r\n​Join me here.

And you’re still here, so that means maybe\r\nyou’re having fun with me.\r\n\r\nI’ve never deliberately “practiced” my copywriting ability, I\r\njust wrote.\r\n\r\nI started sending emails to this list in September 2021.\r\n\r\nThere were probably 6 people who’d subscribed, including my 4\r\nburner emails, my mother, and grandma.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, I was effectively an autistic Chinese child who\r\ndidn’t speak a word of English (if that offended you, grow up).\r\n\r\nI had no idea what I was talking about, nothing to sell, and very\r\nfew people who cared to listen to what I was saying.\r\n\r\nBut I started anyway.\r\n\r\nI developed my own style, my writing became more clear, and I\r\nbegan articulating the ideas that were rattling around in my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nAlong with the newsletter, I was consistently tweeting and\r\njournaling.\r\n\r\nThis was the “training camp” that prepared me to work with\r\nclients.\r\n\r\nI’d read a few copywriting books, I practiced every day (even\r\nthough it didn’t feel like practice), and I became half-decent at\r\nthis writing thing.\r\n\r\nIt’d be impossible not to.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite copywriting books is The Boron Letters by Gary\r\nHalbert.\r\n\r\nThe reason I like it is because it feels personal (he wrote it to\r\nhis son while he was in jail).\r\n\r\nInstead of writing in a super authoritative tone, it reads as if\r\nit’s a journal with insights and tips sprinkled throughout.\r\n\r\nYou can tell he clearly enjoys writing and isn’t putting any\r\npressure on himself to be grammatically correct or follow any\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nThis is how you have to practice.\r\n\r\nWrite about your day.\r\n\r\nWrite about something you enjoy.\r\n\r\nWrite about how you overcame a difficult time in your life.\r\n\r\nWrite about the weird crush you have on your cleaning lady\r\n(creep).\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter what you write about, as long as you find a way\r\nto enjoy it, and it doesn’t feel like work.\r\n\r\nOk?\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\nEnough for today.\r\n\r\n​Join me in the Artisan Lab if you want to get rich.

Start today if you haven't.\r\n\r\nThe second thing is walking.\r\n\r\nWhat better way to clear your head?\r\n\r\nIt’s literally impossible to be sad when the sun is shining and\r\nbirds are chirping.\r\n\r\nI could watch my best friend get eaten by a lizard but if it’s a\r\nnice day I’ll get over it.\r\n\r\nOk maybe that’s an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nBack to the point.\r\n\r\nOn my walk in the sun this morning, I thought about my life.\r\n\r\nI realized that success comes in waves.\r\n\r\nThere will be times where I can pull out my phone, make a minute\r\nlong video and get a million views.\r\n\r\nAnd there will be times where I feel like I’m spewing gold into\r\nthe camera only for a couple thousand people to even see it.\r\n\r\nEvery wave eventually crashes.\r\n\r\nBut the ocean never stops moving.\r\n\r\nYour time will come.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re riding a wave right now, get as much as you can out\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nLast thing:\r\n\r\nI also realized how ungrateful I was being by complaining about\r\nmetrics.\r\n\r\nPeople leave comments and reply to my emails telling me how much\r\nI’ve impacted their lives, but I’m unhappy because the views are\r\ndown?\r\n\r\nWhat a bitch.\r\n\r\nDo not take for granted what you have, just because you want\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nGreed will make you lose it all.\r\n\r\nI appreciate you bo.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading my emails and engaging with my content.\r\n\r\nI’ll stop taking you for granted.\r\n\r\nHave a great day,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "Three days ago I sent you an email about how my content hadn’t\r\nbeen getting many views.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I had three videos go semi-viral on Tik Tok.\r\n\r\nWhenever this happens, it fries my dopamine receptors for a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nEvery time I refresh the app, I have more comments, follows, and\r\ndm’s.\r\n\r\nAnd since I’m addicted to dopamine, I end up spending the whole\r\nday staring at my phone.\r\n\r\nIt’s funny how this works.\r\n\r\nIn my email the other day, I talked about how success comes in\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nIt felt like I’d been paddling, trying to catch a wave for a\r\nwhile and I was getting restless.\r\n\r\nBut I knew I just had to keep trying.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, I caught three waves in a row.\r\n\r\nThe obvious lesson there is that you never know when your time\r\nwill come but if you keep shooting, you can’t go wrong.\r\n\r\nThe less obvious lesson is that “good and “bad” do not exist in\r\nreality, they are constructs of the mind.\r\n\r\nI know it might sound like I’m reaching in an attempt to sound\r\ninsightful right now and you’re like, “Ok buddy whatever the fuck\r\nthat means.”\r\n\r\nAllow me to explain.\r\n\r\nWhen I was frustrated about my content not performing, it was a\r\nlot easier to sit and work on real business tasks.\r\n\r\nIt was the source of the lesson in my email the other day.\r\n\r\nAnd it forced me to not let my desire for external validation\r\ncontrol and discourage me.\r\n\r\nYou could make the argument that my content flopping was actually\r\na “good” thing.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, because I’ve had these few videos go viral, it’s\r\nbeen really difficult to do anything else.\r\n\r\nSitting at my desk to do real work feels like a herculean feat.\r\n\r\nI’m constantly checking my phone and I now feel an added pressure\r\nto make my videos continually perform.\r\n\r\nAgain, we could make a solid argument here for why virality is a\r\n“bad” thing.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, neither of those conclusions would be completely\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nIt simply is as it is.\r\n\r\nThere are countless pro’s when a situation isn’t going as you’d\r\nhoped.\r\n\r\nThere are countless con’s when a situation is going exactly how\r\nyou wanted it.\r\n\r\nIt’s your perception that makes it good or bad.\r\n\r\nDon’t get caught up in that perception.\r\n\r\nAnd remember, every hurdle is part of a bigger plan.\r\n\r\nAlright I gotta get back to scrolling.\r\n\r\nBut before I do, quick plug – I went on this podcast recently and\r\ndiscussed some things I haven’t talked much about publicly.

    "body": "Happy Monday.\r\n\r\nOn my walk this morning I overheard a guy talking about the\r\nhospitality industry.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like times are tough right now.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine who works in nightlife told me the same thing\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\nAllegedly, a lot of the bigger clubs and restaurants are losing\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nLike, lots of money.\r\n\r\nI began thinking about how complex it must be to run a\r\nhospitality group.\r\n\r\nBetween staffing, opening new locations, logistics, operations\r\nand a myriad of other factors I’m probably overlooking.\r\n\r\nAnd then finally on top of all that, the most important piece;\r\nmarketing.\r\n\r\nYou have to deal with all of these annoying logistical issues and\r\neven once you solve all of them, you will still fail if you don’t\r\nget people in the doors.\r\n\r\nThat does not sound like a fun time.\r\n\r\nLet’s compare this to an online service based business or\r\ncoaching business.\r\n\r\nThere are two main objectives in each of these.\r\n\r\n1. Create an attractive, in-demand offer.\r\n\r\n2. Generate demand.\r\n\r\nIt’s actually the same process of building a club or restaurant,\r\nwithout the world of complexity attached to it.\r\n\r\nWith an internet business, all you have to do is learn some\r\nskills and build the offer.\r\n\r\nThat can take a week.\r\n\r\nAnd basically costs nothing.\r\n\r\nOnce the offer is built, you can dedicate the majority of your\r\nfocus to acquisition.\r\n\r\nIf your content gets attention, or you build a lucrative outbound\r\nsystem, or you can profitably put a dollar into Facebook and get\r\n$2 back, scaling becomes easy.\r\n\r\nYou double down on the acquisition system and you make sure\r\nnothing breaks on the backend.\r\n\r\nNext thing you know, you have a $5m/year business that was built\r\noff a couple TikTok videos, loom pitches, or cringy ads.\r\n\r\nObviously I’m oversimplifying this a bit, but it really is this\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nYou lose when you try to make it more complicated.\r\n\r\nIf you’re struggling to grow as a service provider or a coach,\r\none of two things are happening.\r\n\r\n1. You’re focusing on the wrong things and distracting yourself\r\nfrom the actual needle movers.\r\n\r\n2. You’re just really dumb. No offense, but you are cooked. I\r\nthink McDonalds is hiring though.\r\n\r\nYou might not realize it, but opportunity in the info-product\r\nspace right now is similar to the way paid ads were 10-15 years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nI was in diapers back then, but a friend of mine told me he was\r\ngetting 1 cent cost per click on his ads.\r\n\r\n1 cent.\r\n\r\nMeaning, holy fuck, you’re gonna get rich.\r\n\r\nBut over time, that opportunity diminishes and it gets more\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nRight now, in 2024 you can whip out your phone and make a 48\r\nsecond selfie video that millions of people could see.\r\n\r\nIf the content in the video is somewhat useful and you have an\r\noffer that correlates with it, you now have a seven figure\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nI’m not exaggerating.\r\n\r\nIdiots are getting rich.\r\n\r\n​Do you want to join them?

    "body": "Gooooood morning!\r\n\r\nI’m sitting on my balcony and the sun is beaming in my eyes so\r\nI’m squinting at the screen.\r\n\r\nMy neighbors just let out their dogs to take their morning piss\r\non this mat of grass that they’ve been trained to urinate on.\r\n\r\nThey have these two little beige pugs named Ricco and Rocco.\r\n\r\nThose aren’t actually their real names but it’s what I would have\r\nnamed them.\r\n\r\nI’m going to steal them one day.\r\n\r\nAnyway, let’s talk about how to get lucky.\r\n\r\nSome people say luck doesn’t exist.\r\n\r\nOthers believe everyone who’s successful gets lucky.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, both of the above statements are true, even though\r\nthey’re contradictory.\r\n\r\nThis is called a paradox, in case you slept through that part of\r\nEnglish class.\r\n\r\nI watched a movie last night that had Miles Teller in it and\r\nbegan thinking about how you end up as a world famous actor.\r\n\r\nSure, he’s great at what he does.\r\n\r\nBut so are the tens of thousands of broke actors.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of people with the same look, talent, and work\r\nethic.\r\n\r\nWhy is he one of few who makes it?\r\n\r\nIs it luck?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nWell, yes.\r\n\r\nWell, kind of.\r\n\r\nIf you run a quick Google search on Miles Teller, you’ll see that\r\nhe made his first feature film in 2010.\r\n\r\nThree years later, he starred in “The Spectacular Now” which put\r\nhim on the map.\r\n\r\nAnd then the film, “Whiplash” a year later was his big\r\nbreakthrough.\r\n\r\nNow he’s one of the more popular actors and was recently in Top\r\nGun with Tom Cruise.\r\n\r\nBut you don’t hear about all the projects that flopped.\r\n\r\nFrom 2004-2010 he was in a bunch of movies neither of us have\r\never heard of.\r\n\r\nThen he had a few “big breaks” and his life changed forever.\r\n\r\nThis is how success works.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the time that you put in, especially in the\r\nbeginning, will feel like it’s all for nothing.\r\n\r\nYou’ll think to yourself, “why am I even working this hard?\r\nNobody’s gonna notice me anyway.”\r\n\r\nIt’s an uphill battle and you have no idea where the top of the\r\nhill is.\r\n\r\nYou just keep climbing and hope that eventually you find it,\r\nwhich isn’t guaranteed.\r\n\r\nYou could climb for decades and still end up as one of the\r\nunknown actors who never found a good role.\r\n\r\nIt’s a gamble.\r\n\r\nMaybe you’ll get lucky, maybe you won’t.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are ways that you can increase your chances.\r\n\r\nConsistency plus iteration creates luck.\r\n\r\nI think that's the smartest thing I’ve said all year.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t quit and you continually strive to get better at the\r\ncraft, you have a chance.\r\n\r\nWorst case scenario, it’s likely that your effort will result in\r\nan opportunity, even if it’s not the one you were anticipating.\r\n\r\nAnd best case scenario…\r\n\r\n​Well, the sky's the limit.

    "body": "Up until my junior year of high school, I was dead set on playing\r\ncollege basketball.\r\n\r\nBeing a “hooper” was my entire identity.\r\n\r\nBut over the previous year, some doubt had started to creep in.\r\n\r\n“Maybe this isn’t right for me anymore,” a voice in my head would\r\ntell me.\r\n\r\nI tried to ignore it, but it wouldn’t go away.\r\n\r\nWhen I’d consider what life would be like if I decided not to\r\nplay collegiately, it was daunting.\r\n\r\nAll of my friends and family knew me as this basketball guy.\r\n\r\nIt’s how I viewed myself.\r\n\r\nHow embarrassing would it be to change that?\r\n\r\nI’d look like a crazy person.\r\n\r\nAnd I had no idea what’s on the other side.\r\n\r\nBut I couldn’t shake that feeling in my gut that knew it was time\r\nfor a different route.\r\n\r\nIn a single moment, I made the decision.\r\n\r\nI was no longer going to play in college.\r\n\r\nIt was time to let that story go and when I did, I became free.\r\n\r\n“Walking away from anything you love because it’s not working for\r\nyou is the only character building exercise there is. People\r\ncan't comprehend how much you have to screw yourself over to get\r\nself respect.” - Brute\r\n\r\nIt’s no secret that change is difficult.\r\n\r\nChanging your habits is painful.\r\n\r\nChanging your career path is painful.\r\n\r\nChanging your negative thought patterns is painful.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, most people elect to endure situations that\r\naren’t right for them in order to avoid the pain that comes with\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nSure, working a job you hate sucks, but quitting that job to bet\r\non yourself would be temporarily more painful than staying in it.\r\n\r\nYour willingness to exchange this low level, long term pain for\r\nhigh level, short term pain is what makes you grow.\r\n\r\nYou choose to dig the hole a little deeper.\r\n\r\nYou choose to put yourself in a tough situation.\r\n\r\nYou choose to sacrifice your (illusionary) peace for struggle.\r\n\r\nAnd then you’re free.\r\n\r\nIt’ll be difficult and even after making the decision your ego\r\nwill try to pull you back into comfort.\r\n\r\nBut if you can withstand that tide, you’ll make it to the other\r\nside as a new person.\r\n\r\nComfort kills you slowly. Pain kills you instantly.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe that’s what you need.\r\n\r\nHappy Monday,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. Join me inside my mastermind if you’re ready to grow.

    "body": "Let’s talk about money.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re a beginner, you typically think you need to find the\r\nright business model.\r\n\r\nIn reality, it’s not the label that’s important.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re a copywriter, IPGA, IPO, growth operator, growth\r\npartner, etc.\r\n\r\nAll of these terms are different ways to say the same thing.\r\n\r\nYou offer ‘done for you’ services to online businesses.\r\n\r\nThis is important to understand because a business model doesn’t\r\nmake you money, your skillset does.\r\n\r\nPeople like me, Pierre Khoury, and others who’ve had success in\r\nthis space have been able to do so because we can offer a\r\nmultitude of services and truly increase revenue.\r\n\r\nIt’s definitely NOT because of a fancy label we placed on our\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to my second point, which is that the market\r\ndecides your niche.\r\n\r\nIn my business, our biggest wins have come through webinars.\r\n\r\nIt’s the main reason I’ve gotten to 6 figure months.\r\n\r\nBut that happened on accident.\r\n\r\nWe tested a webinar for a client and it worked.\r\n\r\nWe figured we’d try it out for other clients and it kept working.\r\n\r\nThat doesn’t mean that your business has to work the same way as\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nYour big wins could come through VSLs.\r\n\r\nOr you could figure out that you’re really good at scripting YT\r\nvideos or short form content.\r\n\r\nOr maybe you end up specializing in email automations.\r\n\r\nMy point here is that you’re a marketer, not a robot.\r\n\r\nIf you label yourself as a growth operator and you’ll only work\r\nwith creators who have an audience but don’t have an offer yet,\r\nyour TAM (total addressable market) is limited.\r\n\r\nBut if you drop the label and think of yourself as a marketer,\r\nyou can fit into different roles.\r\n\r\nThat’s how you get your foot in the door with a client (solve one\r\nniche problem they’re facing) and then you start to take over\r\nother pieces of their business.\r\n\r\nGet one big win, and you have a solidified offer.\r\n\r\nThis doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s the best way to do it if\r\nyou wanna work with coaches and course creators.\r\n\r\nLearn some skills, pitch a bunch of shit, see what works, double\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nNow you’re rich.

Do I need to start taking viagra? Am I\r\ndeveloping cataracts?\r\n\r\nOh no.\r\n\r\nI’m going to New York with my friends Jimmy and Mason today.\r\n\r\nWe have quite the weekend planned, but if I told you about it,\r\nI’d have to kill you.\r\n\r\nI don’t think I could ever live in NY.\r\n\r\nI have one major flaw and it’s that I’m geographically\r\nchallenged.\r\n\r\nI don’t know what body of water I’m looking at off my balcony\r\nright now.\r\n\r\nI don’t know if I’m facing east, west, north, south, or upside\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nI don’t know how to get nearly anywhere without a GPS.\r\n\r\nMiami is relatively small and I have a hard enough time\r\nnavigating it.\r\n\r\nI can’t imagine how lost I’d be in New York.\r\n\r\nPlus I’d have a bunch of angry neurotic people yelling at me.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of, the other day I watched a clip of Jerry Seinfeld and\r\nLarry David.\r\n\r\nThey were talking about Seinfeld, and how it was “a show about\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nThis is an email about nothing.\r\n\r\nWell actually, I guess I do have something to tell you:\r\n\r\nSorry.\r\n\r\nI’ve been slacking on Youtube.\r\n\r\nI was growing really quickly at first, then I hit a plateau, and\r\ngot too caught up in the numbers.\r\n\r\nMy focus went from “how can I make content that I enjoy?”\r\n\r\nTo “how can I hook these stupid little lizard brained monkeys\r\ninto watching more of my video so the algorithm pushes it?”\r\n\r\nAnd that took the fun out of it.\r\n\r\nI’m gonna get back on there and stop worrying about the metrics,\r\nI promise.\r\n\r\nBut it might be a few days because there’s a solid chance I get\r\nlost in New York.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here’s my last thought for you today:\r\n\r\nYou can always find a reason to stress when you tie your sense of\r\nself to your accomplishments.\r\n\r\nIn that sense, you’ll never be complete.\r\n\r\nSure, this can be a way to motivate yourself but it also stains\r\nevery experience with jaded glasses.\r\n\r\nYou’ll be in the club in New York with a dozen models around you\r\nand your favorite song playing as you dance with your best\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nBut you won’t be all the way there.\r\n\r\nThere will be a part of you that’s anxious, worrying about how\r\nyou don’t have $100m yet.\r\n\r\nInstead, learn to accept what is.\r\n\r\nYou’re on your journey and that’s that.\r\n\r\nStressing doesn’t fix anything, so you might as well be where you\r\nare.\r\n\r\nCongrats. You’ve completed this email about nothing.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you made it all the way down here.\r\n\r\nSee you in NY,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. Join my mastermind here.

    "body": "Gm bo.\r\n\r\nThe other day I figured out that 15 minute walks in the morning\r\nare the perfect distance.\r\n\r\nIf the walk is too long, it makes me feel like I’m wasting time.\r\n\r\nIf it’s too short, I’m too restless to sit at my desk.\r\n\r\nAnyway, today I want to tell you how to get rich.\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, I hit my first $30k month.\r\n\r\nI had no team members so it was pure profit.\r\n\r\nFor the following six months, my income fluctuated between\r\n$30-50k per month.\r\n\r\nThis was one of my favorite times in running my info-product\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nThe work was pretty simple because I was mostly just building\r\nfunnels and managing email marketing.\r\n\r\nAnd on my perfect 15 minute walk this morning, I realized this is\r\nthe perfect way for anyone to start.\r\n\r\nSo if you’re towards the beginning of your journey, here’s my\r\nbraindead simple process for you to get to $10k-30k/month ASAP:\r\n\r\n1. Learn copywriting\r\n\r\nRead books, watch Youtube videos, and start writing sample copy.\r\n\r\nYou can improve quickly, you just have to get reps.\r\n\r\nWriting on Twitter or pretending you have your own email list can\r\nalso be helpful.\r\n\r\nStudy good copy and your subconscious will recognize patterns.\r\n\r\nBut DO NOT overthink this.\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to be the best writer in the world, you just have\r\nto be competent.\r\n\r\n2. Start outreach\r\n\r\nStart before you feel 100% ready, as most learning is done on the\r\nfly.\r\n\r\nGo through social media, find people that are selling coaching\r\nand pitch them.\r\n\r\nJust don’t be an idiot and copy what everyone else tells you to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThis part is a grind but the bar is low because everyone else is\r\ndumb.\r\n\r\nIf you send a good pitch, you have a chance.\r\n\r\nI’ve literally sent one outbound pitch this entire year and it\r\nlanded me a 5 figure deal.\r\n\r\n3. Just say yes\r\n\r\nIf you understand copywriting, learning other skills is easy.\r\n\r\nI could teach you how to write a VSL in 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nSame with managing CRMs, automations, and literally any other\r\nrelevant skill.\r\n\r\nJust because you haven’t done something before doesn’t mean\r\nyou’re not one Google search away.\r\n\r\nIf you get an opportunity, take it.\r\n\r\nThat’s literally how I learned everything.\r\n\r\nA client would come to me with a need, I’d say “yes I can do\r\nthat” and boom, I figured it out.\r\n\r\nIt’s really that simple.\r\n\r\nJust don’t get distracted along the way.\r\n\r\n​If you want my personal coaching in your own journey to wealth,\r\ngo here.

    "body": "bo, let’s talk business.\r\n\r\nI have a secret to tell you.\r\n\r\nIt’s a secret that may alter your current view of the\r\ninfo-product space.\r\n\r\nAnd it especially applies to you if you’re trying to get clients.\r\n\r\nHere it is:\r\n\r\nIt is extremely unlikely that you close a good client on a rev\r\nshare.\r\n\r\nThis notion that the best way to work with creators is to get\r\nthem on a 30-50% rev share and run their entire backend is a\r\npipedream.\r\n\r\nAlmost no good potential client would agree to that.\r\n\r\nPlus most of the good ones are already working with someone like\r\nme, Pierre, Bo, one of my students, or they have an in-house\r\nteam.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn’t mean you’re cooked.\r\n\r\nIt means you have to work your way up to rev shares.\r\n\r\nThe way to do this is to find small gaps in info-product\r\nbusinesses instead of going for the whole pie.\r\n\r\nThink of yourself as a marketer, not a growth operator.\r\n\r\nYour goal is to solve one problem, earn trust, and then solve\r\nother problems.\r\n\r\nThat’s how you eventually end up on a rev share where you can\r\nmake $10k+ from a single client.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn’t happen overnight, it happens when you “earn your\r\nstripes.”\r\n\r\nIf I started all over, there are three services I’d mainly be\r\npitching right now:\r\n\r\n1. Email copywriting\r\n\r\n2. VSL scripting and funnel build\r\n\r\n3. Short form scripts\r\n\r\nThose are all easy to learn and they get your foot in the door.\r\n\r\nYou can get an upfront fee or a retainer to start.\r\n\r\nOnce that goes well, you then start to offer other services and\r\ntake over more elements to your clients business.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, I hit my first $25k month doing exactly this.\r\n\r\nI didn’t have any big “whale\" clients.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of a few email retainers, and I closed a couple\r\nclients that needed new VSL funnels.\r\n\r\nI went above and beyond for my clients, and that’s how I\r\neventually got rev shares.\r\n\r\nThe point I’m trying to make here is this:\r\n\r\nDo not put yourself in a box.\r\n\r\nPitch email retainers, VSLs, scripts, funnels, etc.\r\n\r\nOnce you get some experience, you'll have more leverage.\r\n\r\nThat's when you can get rev shares.\r\n\r\nBy then you'll have results to show for, and actually become a\r\nskilled marketer.\r\n\r\nSkills last forever, “business models” do not.\r\n\r\n​Join me over here if you’re ready to build your Info-product\r\nagency.

If you expect it to be easy, you’ll quit.\r\n\r\nBut on the other side of resistance, you start moving with the\r\ntide.\r\n\r\nThe work starts to feel like peace and you develop this love for\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt’s one of the most beautiful emotional states that you can\r\naccess in life.\r\n\r\nBut you have to earn it by getting over that resistance in the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nSo either do the work, or be a pussy forever lol.\r\n\r\nOk last one - there were a bunch of questions about doing\r\noutreach.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the problem.\r\n\r\nYou’re looking for an “outreach system.”\r\n\r\nThis is why every pitch I see absolutely sucks.\r\n\r\nYou’re trying to rush the process as if you’re attempting to get\r\na girl to go home with you 3 minutes into a date.\r\n\r\nIt’s creepy and you didn’t demonstrate any value or status.\r\n\r\nWhy would someone trust you?\r\n\r\nThe only outreach tip you’ll ever need is to use your brain.\r\n\r\nIf you’re competent, you’ll figure out a way to get in touch with\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not, well someones gotta flip the burgers.\r\n\r\nI know that’s a bit harsh but it’s the truth.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all the questions, sorry if I didn’t get to\r\nyours.\r\n\r\n​Anyway, check out this new interview I did with Sean, one of my\r\nmastermind members.

    "body": "Good morning, bo.\r\n\r\nYou know, success is really simple.\r\n\r\nThere are only two things you actually need.\r\n\r\nEverything else is just noise.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is you have to be smart… enough.\r\n\r\nBeing smart enough doesn’t mean you’re wicked smart.\r\n\r\nIt means you can walk and talk at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt means you can figure out how to use Google when you don’t have\r\nan answer.\r\n\r\nIt means you can consume simple information and understand it.\r\n\r\n90% of people I meet are smart enough.\r\n\r\nThe problem is most people doubt themselves.\r\n\r\nThey feel unprepared to start.\r\n\r\nThey over contemplate every potential action.\r\n\r\nThey think success is supposed to be difficult, so they avoid\r\ntaking the obvious actions that will push them towards their\r\ngoals.\r\n\r\nSo sure, you have to be smart enough – but you also have to be\r\ndumb enough to trust yourself.\r\n\r\nThe second element of success is this:\r\n\r\nYou have to consistently work.\r\n\r\nNotice how I didn’t say work hard.\r\n\r\nBut literally just work consistently.\r\n\r\nGenuinely, making your first $10k online isn’t difficult.\r\n\r\nEven making $100k in a month isn’t difficult once you’re in the\r\nright position.\r\n\r\nIt’s just a battle of distractions.\r\n\r\nCan you consistently take one or two actions daily over an\r\nextended period of time?\r\n\r\nOr will you get distracted, discouraged, or lose ‘motivation’ and\r\ntell yourself you need to find something you’re more passionate\r\nabout?\r\n\r\nIf you can resist the latter, eventually you win.\r\n\r\nAnd this doesn’t mean you’re going “balls the wall” working 16\r\nhour days.\r\n\r\nBut rather that you’ve identified your highest ROI tasks and\r\ncommitted to them.\r\n\r\nFor example, say you want to build an info-product agency.\r\n\r\nOnce you learn enough about copywriting and marketing (which can\r\ntake a week or two), there’s one main thing you should do every\r\nday…\r\n\r\nOutreach.\r\n\r\nThat’s it.\r\n\r\nIf you send pitches daily and make a concerted effort to improve\r\nyour pitches, you will get a client.\r\n\r\nYou don’t know when, but it will happen.\r\n\r\nYou just have to work consistently.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re smart enough to understand this email, you’re good.\r\n\r\nNow, you just have to be dumb enough to get out of your own way\r\nwhen you want to perfect every little detail instead of taking\r\naction.\r\n\r\n​You ready to get rich now?

It’d be impossible to do so.\r\n\r\nBut throughout that time, I accumulated assets.\r\n\r\nI became a skilled marketer.\r\n\r\nMy network grew.\r\n\r\nMy personal brand became more prevalent.\r\n\r\nAction created the perfect storm.\r\n\r\nI didn’t wait for it.\r\n\r\nBut before that, I wasted so much time trying to plan the perfect\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nIt’s a fool's game.\r\n\r\nIf you resonate with what I’m saying and you find yourself\r\nlooking for the perfect business model or waiting for some\r\nmagical moment to start, I empathize with you.\r\n\r\nI wanted to know exactly how it’d all work out before I started.\r\n\r\nI’d sit at my desk mapping out the exact steps I’d take to hit\r\n$10k months.\r\n\r\nI’d bounce from one project to the next telling myself that I\r\njust needed the right vehicle.\r\n\r\nBut eventually I realized that intellectualization is NOT a\r\nsubstitute for action.\r\n\r\nIt’s a way to make yourself feel productive without being\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nAnd it won’t get you any closer to where you want to be.\r\n\r\nJust jump and trust that you’ll grow your wings on the way down.\r\n\r\nAre we clear?\r\n\r\nI hope so.\r\n\r\n​If you want to take that first step towards action, this can\r\nhelp you.

    "body": "If there’s one skill that leads to success in nearly domain, it’s\r\nthis:\r\n\r\nThe ability to communicate.\r\n\r\nIt impacts your dating life, friendships, content, sales, and\r\njust about any other human interaction you have.\r\n\r\nOver the past two years, I’ve become a much more effective\r\ncommunicator.\r\n\r\nI used to be timid.\r\n\r\nYou could hear a lack of confidence in my voice.\r\n\r\nI’d overthink nearly every word that came out of my mouth in an\r\nattempt to present myself as someone I wasn’t.\r\n\r\nThis is how most people end up living their entire lives.\r\n\r\nIt’s rare to meet someone who is articulate and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nLike anything, you won’t get better at communicating with others\r\nunless you get a lot of reps.\r\n\r\nAnd that doesn’t include the pre-programmed responses that are\r\nembedded into your head when people ask about your day.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, there are three ways to improve your\r\ncommunication skills.\r\n\r\n1. Writing\r\n\r\n2. Making video content\r\n\r\n3. “High pressure” interactions like a sales call or date\r\n\r\nTake a second and ask yourself when was the last time you did any\r\nof the three things above.\r\n\r\nAnd if it was recent, are you getting reps daily?\r\n\r\nIf not, that needs to change.\r\n\r\nConsider that last interaction you had with someone who you’d\r\ndeem a good communicator.\r\n\r\nHow was their energy?\r\n\r\nDid they seem content in the life they’re living?\r\n\r\nDid you feel good around them?\r\n\r\nOdds are, that conversation was a breath of fresh air.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the reason I’m telling you all of this.\r\n\r\nTo get anything you want in life, you need to demonstrate your\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIf you can’t do that, it doesn't matter how smart or kind you\r\nare.\r\n\r\nIt’s like being a basketball player who’s incredibly skilled but\r\ndoesn’t perform well in real games.\r\n\r\nAll of the work is eradicated by the fact that it isn’t presented\r\nwhen it matters.\r\n\r\nDon’t let that be you…\r\n\r\n​He who communicates most effectively, wins.

If only someone had told me.” - Hank\r\nMoody in Californication\r\n\r\nWhat makes you happy?\r\n\r\nWell, let me rephrase that:\r\n\r\nIf you were watching the sunset on the beach with your best\r\nfriends, what would you need to have completed to fully enjoy\r\nthat moment?\r\n\r\nLet’s break this down.\r\n\r\nWould you be thinking about the work you haven’t finished,\r\nanswered emails, or the thing you told yourself you’d do but\r\nhaven’t gotten around to?\r\n\r\nWould you let that thought take you out of the present moment and\r\ncloud what could’ve been a beautiful, unique experience?\r\n\r\nThis is a position I often find myself in.\r\n\r\nMy life is the exact way I formerly dreamt of.\r\n\r\nThe freedom, relationships, lifestyle, and impact are the things\r\nI wanted years ago.\r\n\r\nYet I still find myself ‘missing it’ sometimes.\r\n\r\nAnd by that, I mean not appreciating the good times because I’m\r\nin my head contemplating a decision or feeling guilty because I\r\ndidn’t accomplish a task.\r\n\r\nIt’s a cloud that can feel everpresent.\r\n\r\nBut when I think about this, the solution is quite simple:\r\n\r\nDo the things that make me feel productive and fulfill my\r\ncreative desire.\r\n\r\nThat’s it.\r\n\r\nIf I do those things, I can enjoy my life.\r\n\r\nIf I don’t, I can’t.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter where I am, who I’m with, or what I’m doing.\r\n\r\nMy unfinished business will sit in the back of my mind like a\r\nparasite.\r\n\r\nI could be across the table from the most beautiful girl I’ve\r\never seen while she yaps about her hair, makeup, or whatever\r\nwomen talk about.\r\n\r\nInstead of listening, I’d be thinking about the text I got three\r\nweeks ago that I didn’t reply to.\r\n\r\nOr the fact that I didn’t write an email that day.\r\n\r\nOr the random side quest that I promised myself I would start and\r\nhaven’t.\r\n\r\nThis sound familiar?\r\n\r\nIt’s impossible to be happy if you fail to do the things that\r\nmake you feel accomplished.\r\n\r\nMany of which may have nothing to do with financial gain.\r\n\r\nBut that desire sits in your soul for a reason.\r\n\r\nIt’s a thirst you must quench to be able to live freely.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is a life where you’ve entrapped yourself in your\r\nown mind.\r\n\r\nYou’re on the sidelines, watching yourself pretend to be happy.\r\n\r\nBut if you can just identify the few things you need to do to\r\nturn each day into a ‘win,’ that cloud will go away.\r\n\r\nYou won’t let unfinished business ruin your peace…\r\n\r\n​And you’ll fully experience the fruits of your labor.

    "body": "Hey bo,\r\n\r\nI’m sitting on my balcony writing to you on a beautiful day here\r\nin Miami.\r\n\r\nThere’s a common dilemma that everyone faces when trying to build\r\na business.\r\n\r\nIt’s the thing that drastically slows down or halts progress\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s this idea that business has to be complicated.\r\n\r\nWe often look for complex solutions to simple problems in order\r\nto avoid action.\r\n\r\nOdds are, you know what step you need to take right now.\r\n\r\nIf you’re trying to get clients in the info-product space, it’s\r\npretty simple:\r\n\r\n1. Learn about copywriting and marketing\r\n\r\n2. Start doing as much quality outreach as possible\r\n\r\n3. Close a client, get good results and repeat\r\n\r\nBut maybe you’re telling yourself you’re not ready.\r\n\r\nYou need to learn more or find some outreach system that you’re\r\ncurrently unaware of.\r\n\r\nThat’s your mind playing tricks on you.\r\n\r\nIn reality, you’re scared to start because you don’t know what\r\nyou don’t know.\r\n\r\nAnd committing to this process will require you to step into a\r\nnew version of yourself.\r\n\r\nIt’s the version of you who doesn’t hesitate and knows you can\r\nfigure things out on the fly.\r\n\r\nWith this, comes additional pressure.\r\n\r\n“What if I get a client and run into a problem?”\r\n\r\n“What if my outreach is horrible?”\r\n\r\nIt’s easier to stay where you are (and who you are) now while\r\nfooling yourself into thinking that you’re not ready.\r\n\r\nThere’s a harsh truth of the universe that you need to\r\nunderstand:\r\n\r\nYou will never be entirely prepared for anything.\r\n\r\nThe stars will never align perfectly until you take the imperfect\r\naction.\r\n\r\nYou can wait forever.\r\n\r\nAnd you’ll sit there, watching others who are no different from\r\nyou get the results that you could’ve gotten, if you had the\r\nballs to start.\r\n\r\nThis is something I’ve learned while coaching the members inside\r\nof Artisan Lab. (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/68u8vxpw9qs8hk46m3xhohpk8g0kkh9/e0hph7h0336knlc8/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n)​\r\n\r\nThe biggest value I’m able to provide people with is conviction.\r\n\r\nBecause they’ve paid me for coaching, they value the messenger\r\nmore than the message.\r\n\r\nMeaning if I just confirm to someone that the logical action is\r\nright (even if they already knew that) my conviction and\r\nassurance is enough to get them to actually do it.\r\n\r\nThe secret is understanding that there is no secret, and you’re\r\nas prepared now as you’ll ever need to be.\r\n\r\nIt’s a cliche, but an accurate one.\r\n\r\nProgress is simple.\r\n\r\nJust actually do the thing that you know you need to do.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I dropped this video yesterday that people seem to really\r\nenjoy.

    "body": "There are three ‘micro-sales’ that need to occur if you want\r\nsomeone to buy coaching.\r\n\r\nIn this email, I’ll reveal them while simultaneously utilizing\r\nthem to sell you.\r\n\r\nShould be fun, let’s dive in:\r\n\r\n1. The mechanism sale\r\n\r\nThis is where you sell someone on the vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to show them why your method to get the desired\r\noutcome is effective.\r\n\r\nExample – you want to make money online.\r\n\r\nThere are countless business models you could choose from.\r\n\r\nAll of them can work, but that doesn’t mean they’re all created\r\nequally.\r\n\r\nMany require capital, years of experience, or rely on finding\r\ngimmicks or hacks in the market and don’t teach you valuable\r\nskills.\r\n\r\nThat’s why the Info-Product Agency is a solid option.\r\n\r\nIt’s not a “business model,” it’s a skillset that makes you a\r\nvaluable asset to any business.\r\n\r\nAnd because the online education industry is rapidly growing, it\r\nmakes logical sense to work with people who sell info.\r\n\r\nThere’s an abundance of potential clients you can work with and\r\nyour ‘competition’ is horrible.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, the pitches I get in my inbox are barely legible.\r\n\r\nSo this means all you have to do is learn how to apply the skill\r\nof marketing to info-product businesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then go find them – which is easy because they want to be\r\nfound (that’s how their business works).\r\n\r\nOh, and it’s basically free to start.\r\n\r\nSee what I did there?\r\n\r\nI made a logical argument as to why my mechanism works.\r\n\r\nThat’s micro-sale #1.\r\n\r\n2. The authority sale\r\n\r\nIf you’re gonna buy from someone, you have to trust them\r\n(obviously).\r\n\r\nTo do this, you need to:\r\n\r\nA. Show that you know what you’re talking about\r\n\r\nB. Show that you have no special advantages or ability that the\r\naudience doesn’t\r\n\r\nLet’s see this in action.\r\n\r\nYour typical guru hits a $20k month one time, then they turn\r\naround and start selling courses.\r\n\r\n90% of their income is from their info-product, not the business\r\nthey claim to be an expert in.\r\n\r\nI hit consistent $100k months for nearly a year before I ever\r\nsold my own info.\r\n\r\nThis business has given me my dream lifestyle.\r\n\r\nAnd I know it can do the same for you, because I was once in your\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nI bounced from one thing to the next, and felt like making money\r\nonline was impossible for me.\r\n\r\nI’d make some money here and there, but nothing was sustainable\r\nor scalable.\r\n\r\nThat was until I found the Info-Product Agency.\r\n\r\nAfter years of trying to make money online, I hit my first $15k\r\nmonth just four months after pivoting to the info-product space.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s why I’m so confident that this can work for you.\r\n\r\nBoom, there goes micro-sale #2, now you trust me.\r\n\r\n3. The personal sale\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, people's biggest hesitations come from\r\ntheir own mind.\r\n\r\nThey don’t believe in themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd it's your job as a marketer to change that narrative and give\r\nthem hope.\r\n\r\nThis is where you use social proof to show them that there are\r\npeople who are just like them getting results.\r\n\r\nHere’s what that looks like:\r\n\r\n​\r\nMy student Briar joined Artisan lab 3 months ago, making just\r\n$3k/mo from his 9-5 (none on his own).\r\n\r\nWith my help, he just hit his first $10k month with his info\r\nagency.\r\n\r\n​\r\nJust two months after joining, Kabrin hit $20k/month after\r\nstarting from scratch.\r\n\r\n​\r\nAnd lastly, Kidous (who runs a software company and is just doing\r\nthis for fun) closed his first info client for $6k/mo + 10% rev\r\nshare. client.\r\n\r\nEveryone you see here is no different from you.\r\n\r\nThey've simply implemented the systems I've given them and\r\nthey're reaping the benefits.\r\n\r\n​Go here now to join them.

Anything can\r\nwork, if you take the time to be creative and stand out in your\r\npitches.\r\n* Take initiative in solving issues that are in the best interest\r\nof the business, even if you are not directly responsible for\r\nthem.\r\n* Think for yourself before asking questions. In most cases the\r\nanswer is obvious and you just need to take the obvious action.\r\n* Your conscious brain is typically not your friend. When you\r\nfind yourself thinking that you need more information before you\r\ncan act, you are fooling yourself.\r\n* If you don’t feel like you’re in over your head, you’re not\r\nsaying “yes” enough. The best way to learn is on the fly.\r\n* Do not obsess over systems and processes. Make money first,\r\nworry about efficiency later.\r\n* Non-scalable actions differentiate you from your “competition.”\r\nEveryone can send dozens of mediocre pitches daily. Not everyone\r\nwill take the time to correctly assess a situation and\r\npersonalize a pitch to solve a specific problem.\r\n* Not every client is going to be a homerun. There are two sides\r\nto the equation and if your client isn’t holding up their end of\r\nthe bargain, there’s only so much you can do.\r\n* Find a way to get your foot in the door. It can make sense to\r\noffer one service, perform well, and take over other parts of\r\ntheir business once you earn their trust and have a better\r\nunderstanding of the gaps in their business.\r\n* The best opportunities are found when a client is making good\r\nmoney, despite the fact that their systems are being overlooked.\r\nFixing those problems is like pouring gas on the flame.\r\n\r\nThere we have it.\r\n\r\nRemember these 10 things and you'll be driving an SVJ in no time.\r\n\r\n​And if you want my personal help in growing your info-product\r\nagency or coaching business, click here.

    "body": "I’m going to fear monger you today.\r\n\r\nLast night I listened to a podcast about the economic and social\r\nstate of young men in America.\r\n\r\nLong story short, the average guy between 18-30 is down\r\nhorrendous.\r\n\r\nI used to hear guru’s talk about this and I’d write it off as a\r\nmarketing angle.\r\n\r\nBut when you look at the data, it’s entirely true (and absolutely\r\nfucked).\r\n\r\nHere’s some stats for you:\r\n\r\n* Over 41% of men ages 25 to 34 make less than $30k per year,\r\ncompared to just 25% in 1975 (adjusted for inflation).\r\n* Young men are 4x more likely to commit suicide compared to\r\nwomen and 3x more likely to overdose on drugs.\r\n* 20% of men (24-35) still live with their parents compared to\r\njust 12% of women.\r\n* 1 out of every 3 men (18-24) hasn’t had sex in the last year.\r\n* Marriage rates have gone down from 70% in 1970 to just 30%\r\ntoday.\r\n* The average man doesn’t buy their first home until age 38, up\r\nfrom age 29 in 1981.\r\n* The median income of young men has dropped from $73k in 1975 to\r\njust $40k today (adjusted for inflation).\r\n\r\nI’m not much of a numbers guy but this is completely insane.\r\n\r\nYoung guys are poorer and more isolated than ever.\r\n\r\nThe days where you could follow the beaten path and live\r\ncomfortably are gone.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have high value skills that you can use to either\r\nbuild your own business of get a high paying job, you’re fucked.\r\n\r\nUnless you have an ivy league degree, you’re gonna be a doctor,\r\nor you have a clear path to making 6 figures in a 9-5, you’re\r\nleft with two options…\r\n\r\n* Be poor, unattractive to women, and live a miserable exist\r\nwhere you’re more likely to kill yourself or overdose on drugs\r\nthan you are to become a millionaire.\r\n* Bet on yourself. Start learning skills. Start a business and\r\nfail. Fail again and again. Want to quit. Push through the\r\nturmoil. Find success. Become a millionaire. Buy your dream\r\ncar(s). Build an amazing circle of friends. Be desirable to\r\nwomen. And live the life you’ve always wanted to live.\r\n\r\nWhich of the two options sounds better to you?\r\n\r\nThe answer is obvious.\r\n\r\nBut you gotta get through the hard part in the beginning where\r\nyou want to flinch.\r\n\r\nAnd when you consider the alternative, that should make it a bit\r\neasier.\r\n\r\nI believe in you.\r\n\r\n​Go here to adopt the mindset that saved me from a life of\r\nmediocrity.

Not for a greater purpose. But for me.\r\n\r\nI wanted to escape the inevitable future pain of mediocrity.\r\n\r\nIs that selfish? Sure.\r\n\r\nBut had I deluded myself into believing that I needed a stronger\r\n“why,” perhaps I never would’ve started.\r\n\r\nI could’ve rationalized, “I’m not motivated and I can’t work\r\nbecause my life is decent as it is.”\r\n\r\nDon’t let Simon Sinek (author of It Starts With Why) fool you.\r\n\r\nYour “why” can be ripping an SVJ through the Hollywood hills.\r\n\r\nYour “why” can be having the autonomy to wake up at noon every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nYour “why” can be club-hopping in Ibiza with a bunch of\r\nungrateful models.\r\n\r\nMy point is stop worrying about your fucking “why” and make\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nDo you want to be miserable?\r\n\r\nDo you want to be poor?\r\n\r\nDo you want to be an incel?\r\n\r\nNo?\r\n\r\nOkay! Then what the fuck else are you gonna do with your time?\r\nLol.\r\n\r\nEventually, your motivating factors will naturally evolve.\r\n\r\nOnce you check off the superficial desires, perhaps your focus\r\nwill shift to retiring your parents, setting up future\r\ngenerations, or saving the Goddamn turtles.\r\n\r\nBut right now, you probably don’t care much about any of that.\r\n\r\nIf you’re honest with yourself, you just don’t want to worry\r\nabout spending money.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s completely fine.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to find some moral justification to stay\r\nmotivated.\r\n\r\nIt’s okay to want something, simply because you want to prove to\r\nyourself that you can get it.\r\n\r\n​Ready to get rich now?

    "body": "Good morning bo,\r\n\r\nI started this beautiful Monday with a 30 minute walk and now I’m\r\nback at my desk.\r\n\r\nImportant topic today – motivation.\r\n\r\nA subscriber left a comment on my recent video (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/38umv9xlk7ukh26ndz6irh4kz0onns7/e0hph7h0dngo50i8/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9sRGpDTy1QN0I2OD9zaT1ZaTZ2X1JvNldzWkNkb2dK\r\n) saying he doesn’t feel like he has enough drive to be\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nHe wants the things that come with success but just can’t get\r\nhimself to do the work.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think of a quote from a super rich guy you may have\r\nheard of named Jim Rohn.\r\n\r\nHe said, “We generally change ourselves for one of two reasons:\r\ninspiration or desperation.”\r\n\r\nThis theory generally holds up when you listen to the stories of\r\nsuccessful people.\r\n\r\nThey were either in a horrible situation and had no choice but to\r\nclaw their way out.\r\n\r\nOr they created the internal willpower required to take\r\nconsistent action.\r\n\r\nI’m in boat number two.\r\n\r\nI was lucky enough to grow up in an affluent environment in a\r\nfirst world country with access to abundant resources including\r\nthe internet.\r\n\r\nTo end up in a position of desperation, I would’ve had to make\r\nsome seriously poor choices.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re reading this right now from your phone or laptop in\r\n2024, odds are you’re in a fairly similar spot.\r\n\r\nEven if you don’t come from any money, there are guardrails in\r\nplace that will likely keep you from ending up as a homeless man\r\nunder a bridge.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, you have the “luxury” of choice.\r\n\r\nYou can follow the rules and live a semi-decent life.\r\n\r\nIt won’t be extraordinary and you won’t exceed expectations, but\r\nyou’ll survive.\r\n\r\nTo me, the idea of simply getting by and forgoing my natural\r\ndesire to create an extraordinary life sounded like misery.\r\n\r\nI knew that if I allowed myself to choose comfort and familiarity\r\nover the slight possibility that everything in my dreams could\r\ncome true, I’d hate myself.\r\n\r\nThat’s where my inspiration came from.\r\n\r\nAlthough I wasn’t truly desperate, it felt like I had no other\r\nchoice but to go after everything I wanted.\r\n\r\nIf it didn’t work out, the guardrails I referenced earlier would\r\nstill be there.\r\n\r\nSo why not attack life with ferocity?\r\n\r\nWhy not try to build myself into someone I am proud to be?\r\n\r\nWhy not trade a dull life for one with ups, downs, and everything\r\nin between?\r\n\r\nWhere I’m entirely in control of my own destiny and I have the\r\npower to make my reality as beautiful as I’d always dreamed.\r\n\r\nThat was my inspiration and desperation in one.\r\n\r\nInspired because I knew it could all be possible.\r\n\r\nDesperate because I knew I wasn’t put on this earth to be another\r\nbrick in the wall.\r\n\r\nYou’re capable of becoming everything you want to be.\r\n\r\nIf you feel like you’re too comfortable to change, it’s because\r\nyou’re not genuinely considering just how uncomfortable life\r\nwould be if you let others make your decisions for you.\r\n\r\nThat’s enough motivation for me.\r\n\r\nReply and let me know if you liked this one.\r\n\r\nHappy Monday :)\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/38umv9xlk7ukh26ndz6irh4kz0onns7\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/38umv9xlk7ukh26ndz6irh4kz0onns7\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205",

Likely with a much bigger number in your bank account.\r\n\r\nAnd you’ll be incredibly grateful that you didn’t let your\r\nprevious self stop you.\r\n\r\nYou’re just a few small changes away from a completely different\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nGet after it,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nPS Use this to kickstart your journey and make 2025 the best year\r\nof your life.

    "body": "I’m 40,000 feet in the air, writing this from seat 4A.\r\n\r\nHeading home to Cincinnati over the Holidays.\r\n\r\nIt’ll be my first time back since last Christmas.\r\n\r\nThis year has absolutely flown by, hasn’t it?\r\n\r\nI’m using this last week and a half of the year to prepare for\r\n2025 and go into the new year with momentum.\r\n\r\nThis is something I didn’t do a great job of going into 2024.\r\n\r\nI had a rough idea of what I wanted to accomplish and some goals\r\nwritten down, but I wasn’t very precise on the key levers that\r\nwould make success inevitable.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, it felt like I was playing catch up for the\r\nfirst few months of the year.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of something one of my high school basketball\r\ncoaches used to always say…\r\n\r\n“If you’re not 15 minutes early, you’re late.”\r\n\r\nIt takes time to stretch out, tie your shoes, and get some shots\r\nup before practice.\r\n\r\nIf you show up “on time” you’ll miss your chance to get ready and\r\nbe underprepared.\r\n\r\nThis is how I’m thinking of this period until January 1st.\r\n\r\nIt’s the 15 minutes before “game-time” that will dictate whether\r\nor not I go into the new year ready to make it the best one yet.\r\n\r\nI’m ready to make more money than ever, explode on social media,\r\nbuild a bigger team, and simply turn up the dial in all facets of\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nSo if you want to go into 2025 like a rocket shot out of a cannon\r\nwhile others kick their feet up till the new year…\r\n\r\nHere are some things you should get clear on:\r\n\r\nWhat's the one thing that would make 2025 a success?\r\n\r\nThis can be an income goal, fitness goal, social media growth,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSet your standards high and arrow it down to one thing that will\r\nmake you feel accomplished.\r\n\r\nBe as specific as possible.\r\n\r\nHow will you measure your progress towards that goal?\r\n\r\nIf you don’t track it, you don’t improve it.\r\n\r\nCreate a system where you can continually measure your progress\r\nand make sure you’re staying on par.\r\n\r\nThis can be as simple as using a google doc or notion sheet.\r\n\r\nAgain, be specific and write down exactly how you’ll keep track\r\nof growth.\r\n\r\nWhat processes can you put in place that will make the\r\nachievement of your goal inevitable?\r\n\r\nThese are the big levers.\r\n\r\nIf you set an income goal, this could look like “send 10 quality\r\noutbound pitches per day.”\r\n\r\nYou can write down a few things here that have a direct impact on\r\nthe achievement of your main goal.\r\n\r\nThere we have it…\r\n\r\nI highly encourage you to not overlook these three questions.\r\n\r\nI know it might look corny or basic – I tend to have an aversion\r\nto doing things like this too.\r\n\r\nBut this simple exercise can be the difference between a\r\nreality-changing 2025, versus yet another year where you feel\r\nlike you didn’t make the strides you could’ve.\r\n\r\nBe different. Put both feet on the gas. And lap all the dorks\r\nsipping eggnog in pajamas for the next 10 days.\r\n\r\nAnd if you REALLY want to get ahead –go here now (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum20qvx9u6hp8eq6wu5h29rvzllfn/25h2hoh2qlg8ogi3/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) (only if you’re a psycho who’s ready to run through a fucking\r\nwall in order to make this your best year ever).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Get me some fucking double A\r\nbatteries ASAP no rocky!”\r\n\r\nTo your disappointment, your Mom is hammered.\r\n\r\nShe caught your Dad cheating on her with your Uncle so she’s\r\nnumbing the pain with two bottles of Rosé.\r\n\r\n“Dammit! She won’t be able to drive to the store,” you think to\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nTime to take matters into your own hands.\r\n\r\nYou scour the house for batteries, opening the back of every TV\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nNone of them fit into your toy car.\r\n\r\nYou’d ask your Dad for help but he’s upstairs with Uncle Timmy.\r\n\r\nSo you decide to hop in his Ford F-150.\r\n\r\nYou can barely see over the steering wheel so you grab a pipe\r\nfrom the garage as an extension to your foot.\r\n\r\nNext thing you know you’re pulling out of the driveway.\r\n\r\nLuckily you’ve played a lot of GTA.\r\n\r\nBy some miracle, you make it to the store, find the batteries,\r\ncheck out, and make it back home.\r\n\r\nFinally you put the batteries in the bottom of the car and you’re\r\noff to the races.\r\n\r\nCongrats kid.\r\n\r\nNow bo you’re probably thinking...\r\n\r\n“Are you going anywhere with this or are you just telling me a\r\nfabricated, alarming story about an unsupervised child with an\r\nalcoholic mother and gay father?”\r\n\r\nHere’s how this relates to you and your business success:\r\n\r\nRight now, you’re that toy Bugatti.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a complete beginner, you have to get batteries before\r\nyou can start moving.\r\n\r\nThat means you go down Youtube rabbit holes, read books, watch\r\ncourses, and start practicing your skills.\r\n\r\nThe car won’t start moving yet (you won’t make any money).\r\n\r\nBut you’re installing the necessary batteries that will allow you\r\nto go fast.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the trenches :)\r\n\r\nIt’s impossible to say how much time you’ll spend here, but I can\r\npromise you that on the other side is everything you’ve ever\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nOnce you get through, you’ll hit the gas.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're someone who's already been through the trenches...\r\n\r\nMaybe you've been trying to build an agency for a while or you've\r\nbeen grinding in a sales gig.\r\n\r\nAll you need now, are the right batteries -- A higher leveraged\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nFinally, you’ll be rewarded for all of your previously unrewarded\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nJust don’t quit before you even get the right batteries\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you liked this one,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/v8ur65e8vghrhv28wv0fghvnp6mllh9\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/v8ur65e8vghrhv28wv0fghvnp6mllh9\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205",

I am able to go where I want, buy what I want,\r\nand meet who I want. Reality bends itself to my desires. I am in\r\nthe driver’s seat, steering the ship on how my life goes. I am in\r\nfull control. Money loves me. I attract more and more of it\r\ndaily. I find new ways to make money with ease. I live a life\r\nthat has no bounds. My friends look up to me. My parents are\r\nproud of me. I am able to help my brothers. I am the person I\r\nhave always wanted to be.”\r\n\r\nNone of this was true at the time.\r\n\r\nBut 2 months later I closed my first 3 paying clients at $1k per\r\nmonth each.\r\n\r\nBy August, I hit $10k months and dropped out of college.\r\n\r\nI moved to Mexico and reached $15k months.\r\n\r\nNow as I sit here writing to you 4 years later, my life looks\r\neven better than the way I used to dream of it.\r\n\r\nI’ve built a 7 figure agency, grown my personal brand, and\r\nstarted helping others replicate my success.

(\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/wvunperxzdhghk966voc7hn34kzxxc8/8ghqhohl78q33gtk/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n)​\r\n\r\nDon’t stop until you get a client.\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Squeeze the lemon\r\n\r\nCongrats. You got a client or two.\r\n\r\nWhat you do now, can change your life.\r\n\r\nImagine a billionaire hires you as a personal assistant.\r\n\r\nHe tasks you with getting his coffee in the morning and that’s\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo, you spend the rest of your day finding ways to make his life\r\neasier.\r\n\r\nHe sees your hard work and makes you his next of kin.\r\n\r\nThis is *basically* what can happen if you maximize the\r\nopportunity with one solid client.\r\n\r\nGo above and beyond to improve any area of their business, even\r\nif you’re not directly responsible for it.\r\n\r\nThis can snowball into a 5 figure rev share from that client.\r\nPlus a case study you can use to get more clients.\r\n\r\nThere’s your 0-$100k/month blueprint.\r\n\r\nI know it sounds simple.\r\n\r\nThe only part that’s more complicated is the identification of\r\nbottlenecks.\r\n\r\nOnce you get a client, you have to be able to correctly assess\r\nthe levers which need to be pulled to scale them.\r\n\r\nAnd before that, you have to determine if they’re even in a\r\nposition that will allow them to scale.\r\n\r\nIn Artisan Lab, you’ll learn how to do all of this.\r\n\r\nYou’ll know who to reach out to, what a high quality pitch looks\r\nlike, what to offer, how to close the deal, and how to make your\r\nclients a boatload of money.\r\n\r\n​Go here now and apply to join the winning team :) (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/wvunperxzdhghk966voc7hn34kzxxc8/8ghqhohl78q33gtk/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n)​\r\n\r\nTalk soon,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/wvunperxzdhghk966voc7hn34kzxxc8\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/wvunperxzdhghk966voc7hn34kzxxc8\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205",

It’s\r\ndefinitely flat.\r\n\r\nI’m on my balcony watching the boats go by.\r\n\r\nThe water is this beautiful blueish-greenish color and the sun is\r\nbeaming, so it looks even more vibrant than usual.\r\n\r\nSwitching gears to a much more somber note – I truly think some\r\npeople are just NGMI (not gonna make it).\r\n\r\nIt’s not that they can’t “make it” but rather that they won’t\r\nallow themselves.\r\n\r\nThey’re too comfortable in their current self-image.\r\n\r\nThings aren’t bad enough because their perception of risk to\r\nreward is flawed.\r\n\r\nGoing after what they want seems like this big leap of faith\r\nwhere if they fail their life is over.\r\n\r\nObviously that’s almost never the case. If you put your all into\r\nanything, you will naturally unlock an abundance of additional\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nBut they don’t understand this.\r\n\r\nSo even though they may be unhappy, the desire to change doesn’t\r\noutweigh the perceived pain of it.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside looking in it’s easy to see that the “pain”\r\nreally isn’t that bad.\r\n\r\nSure, upgrading any area of your life comes with challenges –\r\nwhether it’s financial pursuit or a different quest.\r\n\r\nAnd sure, there may be some level of risk involved but when you\r\ntruly weigh your options, you see reality clearly.\r\n\r\nYou can stay the same forever, merely flirting with the idea of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nOr you can think, “Why not? I’ll put my all into this endeavor\r\nand worst case scenario I end up back where I was beforehand.”\r\n\r\nDoes that sound incredibly risky?\r\n\r\nTo me, it doesn’t.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s why I think I was able to muster up the courage to\r\nattack my dream life despite the fact that I never had it that\r\nbad.\r\n\r\nAs Socrates once said, “fuck it, we ball.”\r\n\r\nSo as I sit here, writing this from my castle in the sky, I’m\r\ngrateful that I’ve been able to view risk through this lens.\r\n\r\nIt will work out for you too.\r\n\r\nBut you actually have to allow yourself to try.\r\n\r\nI’ll leave you with a tweet I wrote over two years ago – “You're\r\nhesitant to hit the gas because you know it raises the bar. The\r\nfurther you get from the bottom the harder it’ll be to go back.\r\nYou know what you're capable of but you're afraid to hold\r\nyourself to that standard. Then it's no longer an option to show\r\nup every day.”\r\n\r\nGo after everything you desire.\r\n\r\n​It will be worth it, (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum20qvx9u6hp86n2dt5h29ozdlltn/e0hph7h0dxk0kwu8/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n)​\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum20qvx9u6hp86n2dt5h29ozdlltn\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum20qvx9u6hp86n2dt5h29ozdlltn\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205",

But honestly I think the Chinese algorithm is better\r\nthan all of them.\r\n\r\nIt just knows me so well.\r\n\r\nMy fyp consists of Johnny Walker, NBA highlights, and random\r\ncomedy I didn’t know I was even interested in beforehand.\r\n\r\nThis whole situation is like the normie super bowl.\r\n\r\n“Woohoo course seller! Now you have to go get a real job like the\r\nrest of us!!”\r\n\r\nLittle do they know… If the ban strikes, we will stand here,\r\nunfazed.\r\n\r\nReady to pounce on whatever opportunity this creates.\r\n\r\nPlus many personal brands have built an email list, Instagram,\r\nand Youtube. So one platform getting shut down isn’t the end of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of the common skepticism that unaware people have\r\nwhen you tell them you’re starting a business.\r\n\r\nThey’ll say some shit like, “Well what happens when that gets too\r\nsaturated! What if AI takes your job? Can’t a business owner just\r\ndo that on their own?”\r\n\r\nLol.\r\n\r\nYes, unforeseen events can occur.\r\n\r\nYes, there will be times where you are forced to adapt.\r\n\r\nYes, AI is advancing at a rapid rate.\r\n\r\nGood thing you’re a business owner who’s built a plethora of\r\nskills, a network, and developed a mental fortitude that allows\r\nyou to thrive in any environment.\r\n\r\nHold that L skeptic.\r\n\r\nFries. Bag. Now. Extra large coke. Keep the change. You filthy\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nI am an infinite being with limitless potential. My unmatched\r\nperspicacity coupled with sheer indefatigability makes me a\r\nfeared opponent in any realm of human endeavour.\r\n\r\nDamn that really is a bar.\r\n\r\nAnyway this email has gone off the rails a bit but I assure you:\r\n\r\nNo matter what happens with Tik Tok, AI, and any other unforeseen\r\nevents…\r\n\r\nIf you focus on mastering your craft, innovating, and creating\r\nleverage – there will always be endless opportunities at your\r\nfingertips.\r\n\r\n​Your success is inevitable.

    "body": "A client of mine ran his first webinar last night.\r\n\r\nHe’s a Miami resident, so my partner and I pulled up to his\r\nstudio to help him get set up.\r\n\r\nIt was my first time meeting him in person and let me tell you –\r\nthis guy is a savage.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of the email let’s call him Tony.\r\n\r\nTony’s made 9 figures in Real Estate and recently hopped on\r\nsocial media, sharing his story.\r\n\r\nHis audience has grown to the hundreds of thousands fast.\r\n\r\nHe’s got 4 decades of experience in RE. Billions of dollars in\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nWhen someone is this successful for this long, obviously there’s\r\na lot to be learned.\r\n\r\nMy first observation was how energetic he is.\r\n\r\nAlthough he's in his 60’s, he’s sharp as a tac.\r\n\r\nThe guy goes through a pack of Neurogum a day (lol) and is always\r\non the move.\r\n\r\nHe was telling me about this new office they’re moving into…\r\n\r\nThen how he’s shooting content 3 days a week…\r\n\r\nThen about the new properties he’s developing.\r\n\r\nHe just doesn’t stop.\r\n\r\nWorking like this definitely keeps him young.\r\n\r\nI pitched Tony about 6 months ago and we started working\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nHe told me “I went with you because I liked your confidence. It\r\nwas almost arrogance but that’s what you need in a team. I didn’t\r\nwant someone who was timid.”\r\n\r\nSince then we’ve scaled from zero to multiple six figure months\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nAs I’ve met more older, wealthy people over the past couple\r\nyears, I’m always astounded by how normal they are.\r\n\r\nI used to think deca-millionaires and centimillionaires must be\r\nso unrelatable and serious.\r\n\r\nBut as we sat at this burger restaurant after the webby, Tony was\r\ncracking jokes and telling stories.\r\n\r\nHe’s a normal guy – just with decades of hard work and calculated\r\ndecisions under his belt.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the thing about success...\r\n\r\nThe people who achieve it aren't superhuman.\r\n\r\nThey're just normal people who make different decisions\r\nconsistently.\r\n\r\nTony's not successful because he's special.\r\n\r\nHe's successful because he shows up with energy every day, takes\r\nmassive action, and makes calculated moves.\r\n\r\nBut here's what really struck me...\r\n\r\nAt 60+ years old, he's still pushing. Still learning. Still\r\nadapting.\r\n\r\nWhile most people his age are slowing down, he's speeding up.\r\n\r\nThis is what separates the elite from everyone else.\r\n\r\nWant to see exactly how I landed Tony as a client and scaled him\r\nto multiple six figures per month?\r\n\r\n​Get access to the full breakdown inside of here.

Laziness/unawareness\r\n\r\nChatGPT and Claude have been around for a while now.\r\n\r\nMost info-product sellers already know this.\r\n\r\nBut still, they haven’t taken the time to use them effectively on\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nThey prefer bringing someone on to do the work for them rather\r\nthan diving into the AI world themselves.\r\n\r\n2. A vast skill set makes you irreplaceable\r\n\r\nAn email copywriter who writes a few half decent emails a week is\r\nexpendable.\r\n\r\nYou could be replaced with AI or by any of the other horny\r\ncopywriters in your clients DMs.\r\n\r\nBut if you’re offering a multitude of services – funnels, VSLs,\r\noffer creation, sales management, automations, etc…\r\n\r\nYou’re invaluable.\r\n\r\nAI can’t do all of that on its own (although it can help you do\r\nit more effectively).\r\n\r\nWe’re entering a golden era.

    "body": "Last night, I was hanging out with my rich uncle, Rob\r\n(@robthebank).\r\n\r\nWe mostly chatted about content and selling info.\r\n\r\nMost coaching businesses seem to have a relatively short life\r\nspan.\r\n\r\nA personal brand gets hot, capitalizes on (or creates) a trend,\r\nand makes a bag.\r\n\r\nAll they have to do is make organic content.\r\n\r\nTheir systems typically aren’t great and their product might not\r\nbe the best…\r\n\r\nBut they’re swimming with the tide – right place, right time,\r\nright offer.\r\n\r\nThey print with ease.\r\n\r\nThis can last for as short as a few months and probably as long\r\nas a handful of years.\r\n\r\nBut eventually, the tide shifts…\r\n\r\nViews decline.\r\n\r\nReputations get tainted.\r\n\r\nThe market gets flooded with competition.\r\n\r\nThe offer isn’t as hot as it used to be.\r\n\r\nAny of the above can occur and when this happens, the once simple\r\nand easy cash flow business starts to get complex.\r\n\r\nUsed to 80% margins with organic traffic?\r\n\r\nHope you’re ready for that to decline when you have to pay for\r\nevery eyeball.\r\n\r\nAnd if you have subpar systems, aren’t tracking your metrics, and\r\nyour attention to detail isn’t rock solid…\r\n\r\nYou’re in for a rude awakening.\r\n\r\nThis is how info-businesses end up collapsing quickly.\r\n\r\nTheir organic traffic dies down and they don’t build the\r\ninfrastructure to be successful selling to cold traffic.\r\n\r\nScaling through paid ads is a completely different game.\r\n\r\nFirst, your margins will likely get cut down to around 50% or\r\nless as you scale.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine made $2m in a month last year, almost all\r\nthrough paid.\r\n\r\nHe kept around $600k.\r\n\r\nSure it’s great money, but it’s 10x the work and the stress of\r\norganic traffic.\r\n\r\nAnd there’s (almost always) no real enterprise value.\r\n\r\nThe goal is cash flow.\r\n\r\nIf you have to spend $1m/mo, build a huge team, constantly test\r\nnew offers, and sell your heart out to keep a couple hundred\r\ngrand?\r\n\r\nIt definitely gets draining.\r\n\r\nThe game is to stay relevant organically (which is hard to do for\r\nmore than a few years)...\r\n\r\nWhile also building the infrastructure that can work on cold\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nIf you rely solely on one or the other, you’re running a risky\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. If you want to learn how to build an info-product agency the\r\nright way – with systems that work for both organic and paid\r\ntraffic – I can show you here.

Before tip.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, I added vanilla.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the vanilla does in fact cure cancer.\r\n\r\nPretty cool, right?\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking…\r\n\r\nIf you were to spend $8.51 on coffee every day, that’s $3,106.15\r\nover the course of a year.\r\n\r\nMeaning if you make $60k per year, you’re blowing over 5% of your\r\nincome on coffee.\r\n\r\n“WeLl aCtuAlLy, YoU cOulD JuSt MaKe iT aT hoMe.”\r\n\r\nStop.\r\n\r\nHere’s how to make enough money to enjoy your morning stroll in\r\nthe Miami sun and happily buy whatever coffee you want:\r\n\r\nFirst things first, this will likely take two years.\r\n\r\nHey now, don’t leave just yet.\r\n\r\nI know that sounds like a while but stick with me here…\r\n\r\nTwo years isn’t that long!\r\n\r\nOkay, we just lost everyone else reading this so it’s just you me\r\nnow, bo.\r\n\r\nHere are three steps to escape the cubicle…\r\n\r\nStep 1. Learn copywriting\r\n\r\nI’m not saying this to sell you, I’m saying this because it’s the\r\nmost versatile skill you can learn.\r\n\r\nYou can pitch local businesses, eCom brands, agencies, or\r\ncoaching businesses.\r\n\r\nTo reach escape velocity, you only need $5-10k/month.\r\n\r\nThat’s like two or three clients on retainer. Or one solid client\r\non a rev share (tutorial). (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku0o3gldmh5hld5rv3brh8gom999tm/z2hghnh3gdk780sp/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rdHcuaW4vQXNHeUx6\r\n)​\r\n\r\nIf you’re starting from zero, pitch anyone and everyone.\r\n\r\nTake $500 retainers.\r\n\r\nDo free work for a testimonial.\r\n\r\nWork with your Grandma’s friend's niece who owns a wildly\r\nunprofitable bakery (even though she sells $8 coffee).\r\n\r\nYou just need experience and money.\r\n\r\nDo this for six months and you’ll be in a decent spot.\r\n\r\nLet’s say you’re making around $5-7k per month…\r\n\r\nStep 2. Move somewhere cheap\r\n\r\nGet your passport, buddy. I hope you like latinas.\r\n\r\nHead over to Tulum, Mexico or somewhere similar.\r\n\r\nBonus points if you make sure you’re not gonna get captured by a\r\nlocal gang.\r\n\r\nNow it’s time to lock in.\r\n\r\nYou’ll save most of your money and spend the time you’re not\r\nworking on a beach.\r\n\r\nStay here until you start making software engineer money.\r\n\r\nFor me this phase was four months.\r\n\r\nBy the end, I was making around $15k per month and had nearly\r\n$100k in savings.\r\n\r\nStep 3. Bienvenidos a Miami\r\n\r\nTime to up the stakes.\r\n\r\nYou’ve proven to yourself that you can consistently make money on\r\nyour own.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t appear the business will randomly collapse any time\r\nsoon. And if it does you’ve got some cash in the bank.\r\n\r\nOpen up your wallet and find a spot in a bigger city.\r\n\r\nYou’ll likely spend more on rent than you were spending total the\r\nprevious few months.\r\n\r\nThat’s okay, you need pressure.\r\n\r\nBetween the pressure, your now year of experience in the game,\r\nand the connections you’ll make in your new city…\r\n\r\nIt’s inevitable you’ll get to $30k, $50k, and eventually\r\n$100k/month plus.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe I’ll run into you in line to get a cancer-curing latte\r\n:)\r\n\r\nIf you made it down here and you’re ready to do this…\r\n\r\n​Here’s a good place to start.

    "body": "In the past few years I’ve launched countless new offers for my\r\nclients.\r\n\r\nA few flopped.\r\n\r\nA handful did okay.\r\n\r\nAnd almost a dozen made six figures in the first 30 days.\r\n\r\nIn terms of percentages, we’re talking Barry Bonds PED era\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nOur best was a $600k week.\r\n\r\nOur worst was a single $997 sale.\r\n\r\nBut it's safe to say we’ve had a lot more winners than losers.\r\n\r\nHere’s how to successfully crush a new info-product launch:\r\n\r\nPhase 1: The offer\r\n\r\nHalf the battle is identifying what the audience wants.\r\n\r\nThat’ll be contingent on the type of content the client makes and\r\ntheir field of expertise.\r\n\r\nIf they’ve attracted a mass market B2C audience, perhaps a\r\nmid-ticket offer ($500-$2,000) will work better.\r\n\r\nIf it’s a more mature audience and the bulk of the value is in\r\naccess to the client, high ticket is the way to go.\r\n\r\n99 times out of 100, avoid low ticket like the plague.\r\n\r\nOur success has come through selling mid ticket via sales pages\r\nand webinars, or high ticket through a VSL call funnel.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule of thumb, either price it at $3k+ and sell over\r\nthe phone.\r\n\r\nOr price it between $500 to $2k and sell through a sales\r\npage/webinar.\r\n\r\nPhase 2: Pre-launch\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve decided on your offer and price point, now it’s time\r\nto build hype.\r\n\r\nRoughly two weeks before launch, make an announcement on all\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nEmail, Instagram stories, existing communities, etc.\r\n\r\nYour goal is to get people excited.\r\n\r\nIdentify the problem the audience is facing.\r\n\r\nUse these channels to exacerbate their pain and explain how you\r\nhave a solution coming soon.\r\n\r\nYou can also build up a waitlist or start getting people to sign\r\nup for a webinar.\r\n\r\nAs the launch approaches, increase the frequency of reminders.\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Launch\r\n\r\nOffer goes live.\r\n\r\nAnnounce it on all channels.\r\n\r\nHammer the scarcity and urgency – why should they buy now?\r\n\r\nThe first batch can get special bonuses and/or discounted\r\npricing.\r\n\r\nSet a date or (real) limit on how many people get access.\r\n\r\nYou’ll typically have a spike in sales immediately, it’ll sustain\r\nfor a few days, and then it’s time to remind them what they’ll\r\nmiss out on if they don’t get in now.\r\n\r\nThis should create an additional spike towards the end of the\r\nlaunch.\r\n\r\nOnce all spots are filled, or the window is over, don’t go back\r\non your word.\r\n\r\nJust like that, you’ve successfully made a doctor's annual salary\r\nin a week or two.\r\n\r\nAnd you didn’t even have to cheat your way through medical\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nCongrats,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Got about $20K left.\r\n\r\nI should’ve gone to Asia instead of Canada.\r\n\r\nIf you’re living on savings, DO NOT move to the West. The same\r\nmoney would’ve taken me 10x further.\r\n\r\nMade no money while I’ve been here. Just watching my bank balance\r\nshrink.\r\n\r\nMy X account is dead because I barely tweet. Years of growth,\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, some people are making millions per month by selling\r\nsome stupid course on how to get rich.\r\n\r\nI hate how unfair life can be.”\r\n\r\nAs I began reading the tweet I figured he’d turn it around at\r\nsome point.\r\n\r\nYou know like, hook you with a sob story and then tell you how he\r\npersevered.\r\n\r\nBut there is no perseverance in sight.\r\n\r\nJust pity and blame.\r\n\r\nNormally I’m empathetic but this guy lost me when he started\r\nhating on course gurus and said how life is unfair.\r\n\r\nYou can argue with reality, or you can learn the rules and win\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, don’t start feeling sorry for yourself.\r\n\r\nDon’t blame your inadequacies on external factors.\r\n\r\nDon’t harbor resentment for those who find success.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps most importantly, don’t quit before it’s even close\r\nto over.\r\n\r\nThat guy said he had $20k left and based on his spending that’s\r\nanother 6 months of expenses.\r\n\r\nEven if he blew through that, there’s always another option.\r\n\r\nYou are as resilient as you allow yourself to be.\r\n\r\nNothing worth having comes easy.\r\n\r\nYou’ll be tested and tricked. But if you make it through, the\r\nother side is beautiful.\r\n\r\nAnd you’ll know that you earned it.\r\n\r\nYou only lose when you throw in the towel.\r\n\r\nDon’t go crying to strangers on the internet,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Open a new project in Claude.\r\n\r\nI’d upload my last 25+ emails as PDFs.\r\n\r\nThen prompt Claude to build a full breakdown of my style and\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I’d have it create a list of frequent topics I write\r\nabout as well.\r\n\r\nThis would likely be the most time consuming part, but once it’s\r\ndone, we’re smooth sailing.\r\n\r\nStep 2. Transcribe my Youtube videos\r\n\r\nLet’s say I make a Youtube video about why eating seed oils gives\r\nyou superpowers.\r\n\r\nI could take that transcript and upload it to Claude.\r\n\r\nThen I’d say, “Hey Mr. Claude. Please write a complete email to\r\nmy list in my tone and style using a topic from the seed oil\r\nsuperpower video. P.S. You look really handsome today.”\r\n\r\nMy glorious robot would then give me a complete email.\r\n\r\nAnd after a few tweaks, you’d be sitting here reading it with no\r\nidea it’s AI copy.\r\n\r\nThe only downside here is transcribing the videos could take a\r\nbit.\r\n\r\nI share a way where you can drastically speed up that process\r\nhere. (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/e5uxd6r2vzs7hll7kzgi8h8r5g222tl/l2hehmhl54vkodh6/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n)​\r\n\r\nStep 3. Get creative\r\n\r\nOnce I have this AI version of me (which I could actually make\r\neven better by fine tuning it, but that’s a bit harder), the\r\nsky’s the limit.\r\n\r\nI could give it an idea and analogy to use and have it spit out\r\nan email.\r\n\r\nI could tell it to reference a book I’m reading or use a lesson\r\nfrom a certain movie.\r\n\r\nI could have it write a complete email based on one of my Tweets.\r\n\r\nAs long as I’m creative with my prompts, the emails would never\r\nget redundant or feel like AI.\r\n\r\nNow I enjoy writing these so I’ll never do that.\r\n\r\nBut if I wanted to, I could.\r\n\r\nWhich is pretty cool.\r\n\r\nHowever I must add a big caveat here:\r\n\r\nIf you’re not already a decent copywriter, this won’t work for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI’ve written hundreds of emails. I easily come up with creative\r\nanalogies and metaphors.\r\n\r\nThe process is second nature at this point.\r\n\r\nBecause of these reasons, AI can be useful.\r\n\r\nBut without them, it’s like giving nuclear launch codes to a\r\nsquirrel on meth.\r\n\r\nNo bueno.\r\n\r\nStill typing my own damn emails,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

Building a predictable system that scales\r\n\r\nAnd obviously – working really fucking hard.\r\n\r\nHe went from making roughly $120k per year to over a MILLION\r\nDOLLARS per year in 7 months.\r\n\r\nNow – I can’t promise you the same type of results as Jace.\r\n\r\nBecause frankly, his results are insane and he’s a maniac (in a\r\ngood way lol).\r\n\r\nIt’d be audacious to claim you’re gonna 10x your income in less\r\nthan a year like he did.\r\n\r\nBut if you put in the effort…\r\n\r\nAnd if you follow the same principles… (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vukr0nl6oh9h9930kdblhvlgq555fn/dpheh0hezvpwkqam/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n)​\r\n\r\nIt’d be reasonable to assume you can achieve a fraction of the\r\nsuccess he’s had.\r\n\r\nSome students reach $10k months. Others hit $20-30k. And a\r\nhandful, like Jace, go even further.\r\n\r\nThe beauty is that even the \"modest\" results would completely\r\ntransform most people's lives.\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn the exact system Jace used, I've documented\r\neverything inside Artisan Lab. From outreach, to client\r\nonboarding, to scaling strategies, and much more.\r\n\r\n​Apply here to see if it's right for you.

Congrats.\r\n\r\nHere’s how to avoid this:\r\n\r\nDo not overpromise.\r\n\r\nDo not take customers' last dollar.\r\n\r\nDo not claim they won’t have to work hard\r\n\r\nWhen you’re realistic in your marketing, people get results like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n​\r\nDom got a new client 3 days in (this is rare but not impossible).\r\n\r\n​\r\nMarcus got a new client less than 4 weeks in (also rare, not\r\nimpossible).\r\n\r\n​\r\nAnd Vander, struggled for a couple months (perhaps the most\r\nrealistic timeline) but is now breaking through, signing two\r\nclients in the past week.\r\n\r\nI will not promise you get rich.\r\n\r\nI will simply give you the resources, information, and network\r\nthat has made me (and many students) rich.\r\n\r\nWhat you do that this is up to you...\r\n\r\nDo not click here and apply for Artisan Lab (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum20qvx9u6hpzde9nt5h28xwlllin/g3hnh5hmdnodppur/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) if you’re stupid.\r\n\r\nDo not click here and apply for Artisan Lab (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum20qvx9u6hpzde9nt5h28xwlllin/g3hnh5hmdnodppur/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) if you think it’ll be easy.\r\n\r\nBut if you’re a winner…\r\n\r\nThere’s no better place to be.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum20qvx9u6hpzde9nt5h28xwlllin\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum20qvx9u6hpzde9nt5h28xwlllin\r\n) | 113 Cherry St #92768, Seattle, WA 98104-2205",

    "body": "Did you know there are only 902 billionaires in the US?\r\n\r\nAnd somehow they all drive Huracans, sell courses, take high\r\ndoses of TRT, and live in Miami (lol).\r\n\r\nI have one friend who I think could become a billionaire.\r\n\r\nNot because he’s close to it or has any kind of head start.\r\n\r\nRight now, he’s actually the most cash-poor in my immediate\r\ncircle, as a lot of his money is tied up in a software company.\r\n\r\nObviously he’s intelligent, works hard, all of that.\r\n\r\nThose two traits alone aren’t gonna make you billions — the\r\njanitor works hard and the economics professor is intelligent…\r\n\r\nNever seen them in a baby blue Huracan.\r\n\r\nBut there’s one trait that makes me bet on him:\r\n\r\nIt’s relentless. Inconvenient. Borderline annoying.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s…\r\n\r\nCuriosity.\r\n\r\n(Coupled with the ability to spot opportunities and execute —I\r\nknow I said one trait but there’s always some nuance).\r\n\r\nOne day, my potential billionaire friend and I are driving home\r\nfrom the gym.\r\n\r\nI’m in the passenger seat as Lebron (probably not his real name,\r\nobviously) speeds past the cars in the left turn lane, cuts in\r\nfront of them, and makes a left.\r\n\r\nAs I hold on to the roof handle, he begins telling me about\r\nquantum physics.\r\n\r\nMost of it goes over my head as he discusses his predictions and\r\nwhat he wants to build in the quantum realm.\r\n\r\nLet me pause here.\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking, “Ben, your potential billionaire friend is\r\nprobably just a pothead who goes down weird rabbit holes\r\nsometimes.”\r\n\r\nMaybe.\r\n\r\nBut for the right type of person, a weird rabbit hole could be\r\nthe gateway to extreme wealth.\r\n\r\nYou trip and fall and next thing you know you invented the door\r\nhandle equivalent in the quantum realm.\r\n\r\nIf necessity is the mother of invention, curiosity is its\r\ngrandmother.\r\n\r\nNecessity forces you to be curious.\r\n\r\nCuriosity leads you to find new problems.\r\n\r\nAnd if you find a reeaaally big problem - and solve it?\r\n\r\nTime to start picking the type of leather you want on the seats\r\nof your Gulfstream G700.\r\n\r\nSo yeah…\r\n\r\nMaybe “Lebron” ends up broke in five years, yelling about dark\r\nmatter on the corner of Brickell Ave.\r\n\r\nOr maybe he builds something so impactful it forces us to\r\nredefine the word \"genius.\"\r\n\r\nEither way, I’ll keep showing up to hear the next quantum rabbit\r\nhole – because curiosity pays.\r\n\r\nStay curious.\r\n\r\nIt just might make you billions.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. Inside Artisan Lab, we’ve got a bunch of curious weirdos\r\nturning ideas into income. If you wanna get rich without becoming\r\na soulless automaton, you’d probably like it here.

Or more talented. Or even better\r\nlooking (unless it’s me, in which case, sorry bro).\r\n\r\nHe just didn’t stop.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, most people enter the info/agency game with all the\r\nwrong expectations.\r\n\r\nThey think:\r\n\r\n* It’s gonna be passive.\r\n* It’s gonna be fast.\r\n* It’s gonna feel good.\r\n\r\nWrong, wrong, and LOL.\r\n\r\nWhat it’s gonna feel like is:\r\n\r\nRewriting your VSL script 7 times and still hating it.\r\n\r\nGetting ghosted by 33 different leads in a row.\r\n\r\nHaving a panic attack after realizing you owe Stripe $1,200 in\r\nfees.\r\n\r\nThis is not a business for people who crave comfort.\r\n\r\nThis is a business for psychos.\r\n\r\nThe type who’ll build a landing page at 2am just because he had a\r\nweird idea in the shower.\r\n\r\nIf that’s not you – cool.\r\n\r\nGo get a job. Live a peaceful life. Watch Netflix and pay rent\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nBut if it is you?\r\n\r\nThen you need to stop acting like a confused beginner and start\r\nbehaving like someone who’s already successful.\r\n\r\nBecause here’s the truth:\r\n\r\nThere are only 3 things that actually matter when starting your\r\nagency/info-biz:\r\n\r\n* A skill that solves a painful problem\r\n* A system that gets that skill in front of people\r\n* The brain damage tolerance to repeat that until rich\r\n\r\nThat’s it.\r\n\r\nEverything else is masturbation.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need another course.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need a better logo.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to ask your group chat for feedback on your offer\r\ndoc.\r\n\r\nYou just need to move.\r\n\r\nFast. Messy. Relentless. Like your future depends on it – because\r\nit does.\r\n\r\nBen\"\r\n\r\n[End]\r\n\r\nPretty solid, yeah?\r\n\r\nAnd that was with a half-baked, one-sentence prompt.\r\n\r\nObviously there’s still some magic that comes from real-life\r\nexperiences, fresh insights, and having a pulse.\r\n\r\nBut voice-wise?\r\n\r\nI’d say it’s 90% of the way there.\r\n\r\nHere’s the coolest part:\r\n\r\nI now have a repeatable framework I can use with every client.\r\n\r\nImport their data. Feed it the right examples.\r\n\r\nAnd 30 minutes later?

Skill set\r\n\r\nThis one’s the most obvious.\r\n\r\nLearn a skill that other people find valuable, trade that skill\r\nfor money.\r\n\r\nThis is the prerequisite.\r\n\r\nIt’s the equivalent of a college degree in the entrepreneur world\r\n(except it actually means something).\r\n\r\nAs you increase competency, you grow capable of solving bigger\r\nproblems that pay better.\r\n\r\nOnce this foundation is laid, the other two elements unlock…\r\n\r\n2. Opportunity vehicle\r\n\r\nThis is what you’re selling and who you’re selling to.\r\n\r\nThe best marketer in the world will make no money if their\r\nclients are broke.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, apply your skill set the right way (in a growing\r\nindustry where people are making lots of money) you’ll be paid in\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nNail these two, and money starts to rain.\r\n\r\nAnd then, there’s the third which makes everything click…\r\n\r\n3. Influence\r\n\r\nThis is who you know and who knows you.\r\n\r\nIt could mean attention on social media or even just a network of\r\nthe right people.\r\n\r\nThat’s it.\r\n\r\nSkill, vehicle, influence.\r\n\r\nMaster all three and business becomes unfairly easy.\r\n\r\nIgnore even one… and you’ll feel like you’re a stripper without\r\nrhythm. Or an ass.\r\n\r\nSo here’s the move:\r\n\r\nAudit yourself.\r\n\r\nWhat’s missing?\r\n\r\nWhat’s the next smallest move to fix it?\r\n\r\nFor me, working with course sellers was the unlock.\r\n\r\nSkillset? Check — copywriting and funnel building were finally\r\nbeing put to good use.\r\n\r\nVehicle? Check — these creators had leverage, audience, and cash\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nInfluence? Check — proximity to high-level operators opened more\r\ndoors than I could count.\r\n\r\nIt was the rare overlap of all 3 elements.\r\n\r\nAnd once I leaned in, everything changed.\r\n\r\nIf you’re still trying to force something that doesn’t check all\r\nthree boxes…\r\n\r\n​Maybe it’s time to pivot.

The Carrera is a nice daily.\r\n\r\nFrom ten feet away you’d never know.\r\n\r\nBut the second you hit the gas?\r\n\r\nThe Turbo S launches.\r\n\r\nThe Carrera just… moves.\r\n\r\nThat’s the power of what’s under the hood.\r\n\r\nIn the coaching space, your product is your engine.\r\n\r\nAnd most people forget about it.\r\n\r\nA good product means sexier marketing.\r\n\r\nYour testimonials are your rims, wheels, and headlights.\r\n\r\nYou can coast with a shit product…\r\n\r\nUntil you floor it next to someone with real horsepower.\r\n\r\nThen you blow up.\r\n\r\nArtisan Lab is finally to the point where it feels like a V10.\r\n\r\nWhen I started coaching, it was just a private group and a few\r\ncalls.\r\n\r\nI let in 20 people and used it as a test run.\r\n\r\nTook the feedback.\r\n\r\nBuilt out a full course.\r\n\r\nRebranded it from The Bader Group to Artisan Lab.\r\n\r\nThat’s where most people stop.\r\n\r\nThey build the course, toss in some weekly calls, and shift all\r\nattention to marketing.\r\n\r\nBut here’s the truth:\r\n\r\nIf your product isn’t improving, it’s deteriorating.\r\n\r\nSo I kept going:\r\n\r\n* I update the content constantly based on where people get stuck\r\n* Every call is recorded and labeled inside a searchable vault\r\n* I bring in 7–8 figure entrepreneurs twice a month for guest\r\nsessions\r\n* I paid one of my star students to build an outreach course, and\r\nmy sales guy to build a sales management course\r\n* Sean — one of the best marketers I know — runs weekly calls and\r\noffers 1-1 support\r\n* And as of yesterday, Jace (you’ve probably seen him in a\r\ntestimonial) is now running an additional weekly group call\r\n\r\nHere’s the current engine:\r\n\r\nContent – funnels, copywriting, sales, acquisition, personal\r\nbrand & everything in between\r\n\r\n1-1 Support – from me and Sean\r\n\r\nActive 24/7 Community – no idiots allowed, only winners\r\n\r\nCoaching – 3 weekly calls, led by me, Sean, and Jace (plus\r\nbi-weekly guest calls)\r\n\r\nPlus plug and play SOPs, frameworks, and all the other more\r\nboring stuff...\r\n\r\nThis has inadvertently turned into a pitch.\r\n\r\nBut that’s kinda the point.\r\n\r\nWhen your product is actually good, you don’t need to force a\r\ntransition or do some weird NLP sales voodoo.\r\n\r\nYou just talk about it.\r\n\r\nBecause you’re proud of the engine you’ve built.\r\n\r\n​Artisan Lab (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92ung4ow87hnh633kk9b9hzexx633fw/48hvhehmp06834bx/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) is the engine.\r\n\r\nEverything else is just the body kit.\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to go fast, you’re gonna need something under the\r\nhood that doesn’t explode when it gets on the highway.\r\n\r\n​Apply here if you want to build your own Turbo S.

    "body": "I officially became a nerd yesterday.\r\n\r\nI went through what can be described as a business-tracking\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nWhat doesn’t get tracked doesn’t improve – and I realized my\r\ntracking is meh.\r\n\r\nFrantically, I began building automations, SOP’s, and Google\r\nSheets.\r\n\r\nI typically hate doing this type of stuff.\r\n\r\nIt feels like listening to a Miami girl talk about astrology,\r\nminus the lip filler and silicone.\r\n\r\nPainful.\r\n\r\nBut yesterday, I powered through it.\r\n\r\nI set up new zaps, built a Slack channel, and made a tracking\r\nsheet for my Artisan Lab members.\r\n\r\nThe sheet was the hardest of it all.\r\n\r\nIt required complex formulas and I’m a college dropout. Not a\r\ngood combo, typically.\r\n\r\nBut I had a cheat code.\r\n\r\nAny time I got stuck, I’d turn to AI.\r\n\r\n“Hello, my Glorious KingGPT. How do I sum an itemized list based\r\non certain criteria? Plz reply. Thx ily.”\r\n\r\nAI would then give me the exact formula to plug in.\r\n\r\nI’d follow its instructions.\r\n\r\nAnd if anything broke, I’d simply take a screenshot and ask it\r\nwhat went wrong.\r\n\r\nWith AI’s help, the sheet took me around 30 minutes to build.\r\n\r\nWithout it, it would’ve taken hours or I would’ve quit.\r\n\r\nIt also saved me time after a sales call yesterday.\r\n\r\nMy “AI Companion” joined my Zoom meeting with me.\r\n\r\nThe word companion makes me think of dogs, so I named him Buddy.\r\n\r\nAfter the call, Buddy sent me a summary of everything we talked\r\nabout with a detailed plan outlining the next steps.\r\n\r\nSimple things like this have been saving me hours.\r\n\r\nEveryone (myself included) talks about writing copy with AI\r\nbecause it sounds sexy.\r\n\r\nBut what might be even cooler, is it makes the boring stuff\r\neasier.\r\n\r\nUnless you had a Minecraft addiction and were nonverbal in groups\r\nlarger than 2 growing up, you probably hate automations,\r\ntracking, and summarizing data.\r\n\r\nAI makes this way less painful.\r\n\r\nDon’t overlook using it to improve your workflow, outside of\r\nwriting copy.\r\n\r\nThat’s only the tip of the iceberg.\r\n\r\nI break all this down (and more) for my coaching clients.\r\n\r\nIf you're building an info-product agency and want to save time,\r\nmake more money, and not cry while setting up Zapier... apply\r\nhere.

    "body": "Goooood morning bo.\r\n\r\nHere’s an unsolicited POV from my new penthouse in Miami:\r\n\r\n​\r\nI moved in yesterday and let me tell ya…\r\n\r\nMoving sucks.\r\n\r\nHowever, it gave me the opportunity to be a customer and client –\r\nwhich is fun for me as a business owner.\r\n\r\nI’m able to observe what it’s like from the other side.\r\n\r\nI hired this moving company called “Piece Of Cake Moving.”\r\n\r\nThere’s a copywriting lesson in the name itself.\r\n\r\nThey have big pink trucks that stick out like an OF girl in a\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nA quick Google search told me that this is a big company.\r\n\r\nThey have over 350 trucks, employ 800+ people, and handle over\r\n100,000 moves a year.\r\n\r\nThis has made Mr. Piece Of Cake, a rich man – they made over\r\n$100m in 203.\r\n\r\nAnd after they helped me move, I can see why.\r\n\r\nThey were at the top of my Google search, so I clicked and filled\r\nout a form outlining the items I had to move.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later I had a quote for $450.\r\n\r\nI didn’t have a ton of stuff but I had them pack it all up too,\r\nso I found this to be incredibly cheap.\r\n\r\nAppointment scheduled.\r\n\r\nThey followed up with me over the next couple of days, sent all\r\nthe insurance forms, and arrived on time.\r\n\r\nMy main mover was named Jason.\r\n\r\nHe now is the primary beneficiary in my will.\r\n\r\nWe coordinated everything and it was about as smooth and easy as\r\ncan be.\r\n\r\nI ended up having extra items that I didn’t list in the initial\r\nitinerary and he threw them in for me.\r\n\r\nHe moved everything, unpacked, and rearranged furniture in the\r\nnew place (which was outside of the job description).\r\n\r\nLastly, I had a few things that I was gonna take to a storage\r\nunit after the move.\r\n\r\nI mentioned this and he offered to take those items and meet me\r\nover at the unit.\r\n\r\nAfter all this, I ended up tipping him more than I paid for the\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nThis is what success looks like – both as a business and an\r\nemployee.\r\n\r\nWhen you scale, attention to detail is everything.\r\n\r\nMinor sloppiness creates huge problems when you have 350 pink\r\ntrucks around the globe.\r\n\r\nMy booking process was easy and the movers actually cared.\r\n\r\nJason went above and beyond to the point where I wrote an entire\r\nemail about it.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a Yelp review from someone with far too much\r\ntime on their hands.\r\n\r\nBut as a business owner, it’s a great lesson.\r\n\r\nIf my customer experience was this good, on what was probably one\r\nof their lowest ticket moves…\r\n\r\nWhen they have 800+ employees…\r\n\r\nJust imagine the level of attention to detail and care that the\r\nCEO must have.\r\n\r\nIf your product isn’t so good that customers want to become your\r\nmarketing…\r\n\r\nYou’ve still got work to do.\r\n\r\nAnd when you’re the one delivering a service?\r\n\r\nGo above and beyond.\r\n\r\n​Become the Jason of info-products here.

And yeah, that’s part of the game.\r\n\r\nBut they rarely show you the late nights, identity crises, and\r\nfull-blown mental spirals it took to get there.\r\n\r\n“He hit $50k/mo in 3 months” sounds a hell of a lot better than\r\n“He finally hit $50k after spending three years depressed, lost,\r\nand considering accepting the sugar baby offer in his DMs.”\r\n\r\nBut I’ll give it to you straight.\r\n\r\nThis game is difficult because you have to reprogram your\r\nhardwiring.\r\n\r\nYou’ll get discouraged, distracted, almost quit, feel like an\r\nidiot, and then…\r\n\r\nMagic happens.\r\n\r\nI was reminded of all this yesterday when I sat down with Heik —\r\none of the guys inside AL.\r\n\r\nHe joined six months ago making $2k/month.\r\n\r\nToday, he’s doing $10k/month and just flew from Germany to Miami\r\nto meet with clients.\r\n\r\nHis journey wasn’t linear or smooth.\r\n\r\nBut he stuck it out – even when it felt like nothing was\r\nclicking.\r\n\r\nI wanted to share our convo (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92ung4ow87hnh63egexf9hz5d6d33cw/vqh3hrho4vprxrug/aHR0cHM6Ly9saW5rdHcuaW4vbFBmY3lp\r\n) with you, not because Heik’s some unicorn…\r\n\r\nBut because his story is one you might see yourself in.\r\n\r\nThe first $10k always takes the longest.\r\n\r\nBut after that, the game gets fun.\r\n\r\n​Watch the interview here.

Artisan Lab is scaling. Members are\r\ncrushing.\r\n\r\nAnd the best part of all – work doesn’t feel like a chore.\r\n\r\nMost of 2024, I wasn’t very engaged in my businesses.\r\n\r\nFor the two years before that, almost all I did was work.\r\n\r\nThis was great to build a foundation but life just felt dull\r\nafter a while.\r\n\r\nWhy would I make more money if I don’t know how to spend it?\r\n\r\nSo, I learned how to make tens of thousands of dollars disappear.\r\nFast.\r\n\r\nBut I’m out of coast mode now.\r\n\r\nI feel more in control of my business, and there’s this level of\r\nfulfillment that’s met by forward progress.\r\n\r\nScaling feels like creative problem solving rather than an\r\nintimidating headache.\r\n\r\nInstead of dreading calls and items on my to do list, I look\r\nforward to (most of) them.\r\n\r\nI like sitting down at my desk.\r\n\r\nIt’d been a while since I had this type of energy and I forgot\r\nhow incredible it is.\r\n\r\nSo, if you’re in an era where opening your laptop feels\r\nequivalent to being stuck in a closet with Lizzo…\r\n\r\nHere’s my advice to you:\r\n\r\nFirst – you have to really try.\r\n\r\nProfound, right?\r\n\r\nSeriously though, it might just be difficult because you're not\r\nbuilding any momentum.\r\n\r\nGet organized, take some baby steps, and see where you’re at in a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nFor 95% of people reading this, that’s the fix.\r\n\r\nBut if you’re where I was, and you can’t even bear the thought of\r\nwork…\r\n\r\nYou have to shake the snowglobe.\r\n\r\nI am advising you to crash out (potentially).\r\n\r\nMove to a new city, change up your routine, spend more money, try\r\nnew hobbies, do ayahuasca in a forest… idk just do something\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nFollow your natural curiosity.\r\n\r\nI don’t know if this is sound advice, but it worked for me.\r\n\r\nI had to sidequest-maxx to show myself how fun life can be.\r\n\r\nThis made it feel like clicking buttons in exchange for a larger\r\nnumber on a screen is worth it again.\r\n\r\nNow, quick disclaimer:\r\n\r\nDo not take this as an excuse to crash out because you’re\r\navoiding sending outbound messages.\r\n\r\nThere will always be parts of business that aren’t fun.\r\n\r\nSometimes the answer is to power through.\r\n\r\nThere are always parts of business that suck.\r\n\r\nBut here’s the truth:\r\n\r\nInertia = resistance to change.\r\n\r\nAn object at rest stays at rest.

Go back to your little slave job, I’m escaping the matrix.”\r\n\r\nCartman slams the door so hard that The 4-Hour Workweek falls\r\nfrom his desk.\r\n\r\nHe’s “tried” eight different business models in the past six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nAnd although he doesn’t show it, his skepticism grows with each\r\nfailed attempt…\r\n\r\n“Maybe I’m not cut out for this.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t keep wasting time.”\r\n\r\n“What if this only works for people with better skills, luck, or\r\nconnections?”\r\n\r\nDespite the doubt, there’s an inkling of hope underneath it all.\r\n\r\nCartman knows he has the potential.\r\n\r\nHe knows he’s not a complete idiot.\r\n\r\nAnd he’s willing to work hard.\r\n\r\nBut he’s directionless and distracted.\r\n\r\nHe feels like he’s always almost figuring it out.\r\n\r\nBut almost doesn’t cut it.\r\n\r\nCartman closes five of the six laptops.\r\n\r\n“I'm just gonna pick one thing and stick to it,” he thinks to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThat’s when he goes all in.\r\n\r\nThis time, he’s smart enough to ignore the voice in his head that\r\nattempts to talk him into a different opportunity.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, he’s getting on sales calls.\r\n\r\nA couple weeks after that, he gets his first client.\r\n\r\nAnd next thing you know, he’s making $10k/month.\r\n\r\nFinally, he’s cured of his shiny object syndrome.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t need another guru.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t need another YouTube video.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t need to optimize his cold plunge routine.\r\n\r\nHe just needed to make a decision.\r\n\r\nAnd when he finally did, things started happening.\r\n\r\nIf you’re still stuck cycling through new ideas, hoping the next\r\none will magically “feel right”…\r\n\r\nYou’re not looking for the right model.\r\n\r\nYou’re looking for a way to avoid committing.\r\n\r\n​Be like Cartman.

    "body": "I have a confession…\r\n\r\nMy agency basically runs on auto-pilot at this point.\r\n\r\nWe have a small (but dialed) team and a couple really solid\r\nclients.\r\n\r\nIt’s a great set up.\r\n\r\nBut due to my lack of involvement in the operations, it’s been a\r\nwhile since I’ve been in the back-end trenches.\r\n\r\nI’m locked in, scaling Artisan Lab – but I started to miss being\r\nthe wizard behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nSometimes it’s cooler to be the lazy, fat puppet master than the\r\npuppet.\r\nSo a little over a month ago, I had the idea to take on some 1-1\r\nclients.\r\n\r\nMy goal was to find a few early stage info-businesses I could get\r\na large stake in.\r\n\r\nI posted a call to action on my Instagram story.\r\n\r\nNext thing you know, I have what I would describe as a “portfolio\r\ncompany” if I were trying to impress someone.\r\n\r\nI began building the full system for one of these portfolio\r\nclients yesterday.\r\n\r\nQuick context – this client just recently started making content.\r\n\r\nHe built a blue collar business, makes good money doing it, and\r\nis now stepping into guru-world.\r\n\r\nAs of a few weeks ago, we had nothing but a social media account\r\nwith a calendly link in the bio.\r\n\r\nI wanted to first see if his audience was ready to buy anything\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nWe started booking calls and pitched 1-1 coaching.\r\n\r\nNo course, no community, just calls with my client so we can get\r\ntestimonials.\r\n\r\nWe filled up ten spots way quicker than I anticipated.\r\n\r\nNow, we’re building out the course, setting up all the softwares\r\nand backend stuff so we can do a real launch.\r\n\r\nThis will probably take about a week.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I needed a way to nurture the audience.\r\n\r\nI used [an AI tool I won’t disclose publicly until they give me\r\nbetter affiliate terms] to make a free lead magnet…\r\n\r\nI took five of my clients' videos, the software transcribed them,\r\nand I was done in 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nIt gave me a full 12 page breakdown of the business model and my\r\nclient’s journey.\r\n\r\nThen I went over to my friend Chat GPT.\r\n\r\nI made a new project, gave it the PDF, and asked it to write the\r\ncopy for the opt-in page.\r\n\r\nDone in 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nI threw the copy on a landing page and now I just need to write a\r\nwelcome sequence…\r\n\r\n[Read in southern accent for full effect]\r\n\r\nBack in the old days, when I first started – this would be a two\r\nhour project.\r\n\r\nI’d need to manually ideate each email, type away on my little\r\nkeyboard, and finally I’d be done.\r\n\r\nBut I didn’t have what you now have…\r\n\r\nA muthafuckin I.\r\n\r\nI went back and forth with Mr.GPT for about five minutes.\r\n\r\nMy goal was to have it write in my style but my client’s voice.\r\n\r\nMy instructions were clear and he began typing away.\r\n\r\nFirst email done. Banger.\r\n\r\nSecond email, banger.\r\n\r\nThird, fourth, fifth… holy fuckin shit Chat GPT I love you to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[Ok, no more southern accent]\r\n\r\nMy full welcome sequence was done in three minutes.\r\n\r\nAnd it wasn’t some generic, AI sounding copy.\r\n\r\nThe writing had a real voice, humor, and maintained the tone in\r\nmy client's content.\r\n\r\nAll in, it took maybe 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nOffer, lead magnet, landing page, welcome sequence.\r\n\r\nAI didn’t just help – it did the damn thing (because I used it\r\ncorrectly).\r\n\r\nThis is the game now.\r\n\r\nIf you want to build a lean info-agency using tools like this,\r\n\r\nIt’s never been easier…\r\n\r\n​And Artisan Lab is where I show you how.

    "body": "I have another incredibly boring email for you today.\r\n\r\nIt’s about a stupid little topic called \"product.”\r\n\r\n80% of the info gurus just clicked away.\r\n\r\nSo now that it’s just you and me, I’ll be incredibly honest here:\r\n\r\nI used to not give a solitary shit about this side of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t in my job description to care.\r\n\r\nI was the marketer.\r\n\r\nThe rainmaker.\r\n\r\nThe guy behind the scenes who’ll never deal with the customers.\r\n\r\nMy job was to sell.\r\n\r\nSo as long as my clients weren’t absolute scumbags – I’d do just\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nBut after running my own info-business, that’s changed.\r\n\r\nPeople turn their hard earned money into my money.\r\n\r\nThey trust me to care about them and deliver on my promises.\r\n\r\nAnd I’d be an absolute shithead not to.\r\n\r\nThis is gonna feel like I’m indirectly pitching you.\r\n\r\nI’m not, but I kind of am too.\r\n\r\nArtisan Lab isn’t perfect, but it’s always improving.\r\n\r\nI personally talk to every member, have incredible coaches, bring\r\non guests, and add more content.\r\n\r\nYesterday, a new member joined who we’ll call Joe.\r\n\r\nBefore joining, Joe DM’d nearly everyone he could find in the\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nBecause I’m not a sleazy, lying, piece of shit, the responses he\r\ngot were overwhelmingly positive.\r\n\r\nHere’s what he said in his intro message:\r\n\r\n​\r\n(he joined on his bday so we sang to him on the group call lol).\r\n\r\nI say all this because I truly don’t understand how people can\r\nsell something they know isn’t up to par.\r\n\r\nThey’ll do anything to get the deal done, but once you buy,\r\nyou’ll never hear from them again.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps the worst part – they get people to take out a loan\r\nto buy their shit product.\r\n\r\nThere is a special place in hell for you people.\r\n\r\nSure, not everyone will succeed.\r\n\r\nMost will buy and do nothing with the info inside.\r\n\r\nBut that’s not a cop out to neglect your product.\r\n\r\nAnd it feels 10x better when you produce results like this:\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n​Don’t get scammed by a fake guru.

All I\r\nhave to do is collect it.”\r\n\r\nFelix Dennis told me to say this to myself, so I figured I’d\r\nshare it with you.\r\n\r\nToday I'm thinking about dumb people.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, how people who are dumber than me are richer\r\nthan me.\r\n\r\nThat’s wack.\r\n\r\nNow I’m not a genius…\r\n\r\nI can’t change a tire, I’m severely directionally challenged, and\r\nI often misspell simple words.\r\n\r\nBut everyone has their pitfalls.\r\n\r\nStrip Elon Musk of his fame and put him at LIV in Miami.\r\n\r\nHe’d look like the kid who gets picked last in high school gym\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nEveryone has their strengths and weaknesses.\r\n\r\nYour job is to lean into what you’re good at and stop wasting\r\ntime pretending to be someone you’re not.\r\n\r\nLet me show you what I mean.\r\n\r\nI have two friends – let’s call them Nikola and Anthony\r\n(Basketball fans, you already get the analogy).\r\n\r\nNikola’s an operator.\r\n\r\nHe’s analytical and calculated.\r\n\r\nExcel sheets give him an erection and he uses Zapier to automate\r\nhis breakfast order and bathroom schedule.\r\n\r\nBut if you put him in a room full of people, he’ll complain about\r\nhow he wants to go home.\r\n\r\nHe has trouble making eye contact with women and freezes up on\r\ncamera.\r\n\r\nStill, he’s rich.\r\n\r\nHe’s the COO of an 8 figure eCom brand.\r\n\r\nAnthony’s the opposite.\r\n\r\nHe’s incredibly articulate, he can simplify complex ideas, and he\r\nloves the spotlight.\r\n\r\nBut if you told him to build a funnel or set up an automation…\r\nit’d take him 6 hours, 3 breakdowns, and a YouTube tutorial.\r\n\r\nSo he doesn’t.\r\n\r\nHe stays on camera, grabs attention, and outsources the rest.\r\n\r\nBoth are successful. Because they play their role.\r\n\r\nMost people try to “fix” their weaknesses instead of weaponizing\r\ntheir strengths.\r\n\r\nDon’t be like most people.\r\n\r\nFigure out your edge. Go all in on it.\r\n\r\nAnd if you suck at the rest, improve it or get help.\r\n\r\n​Now go collect what’s already yours.

That same day, I’m adding:\r\n\r\n* Another coach (now 4-5 calls/week)\r\n* Extra 1-on-1 calls\r\n* AI modules that’ll help you train ChatGPT to do 80% of client\r\nwork\r\n\r\nIf you go here and apply (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zluew470l3hnhk8ex56fphwzgng00f6/z2hghnhe763nensp/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) before June 1st, you’ll get access to everything we have now,\r\nplus the additions at the current price.\r\n\r\nBut once these updates are live, there's no going back.\r\n\r\n​Commit a highway robbery here.

Almost like I was sold a lie. I go accomplish\r\nall these things, hit numbers, buy fancy shit — and my life would\r\nfeel a whole lot different. But I’m here and it doesn’t live up\r\nto that.”\r\n\r\nWhat I didn’t understand then, was that the same way making money\r\nis a conscious decision…\r\n\r\nSo was my lifestyle.\r\n\r\nI didn’t have any hobbies.\r\n\r\nI didn’t make a conscious effort to meet new people.\r\n\r\nI didn’t design my life outside of the money part.\r\n\r\nSo there I was. Making more money than I knew what to do with…\r\nBut no motion.\r\n\r\nAnd then, I regained consciousness.\r\n\r\nStarted boxing. Started going out. Started playing tennis.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, my lifestyle was exactly the way I envisioned.\r\n\r\nPlus I hit my first $100k month and bought my dream car.\r\n\r\nAll of it came from conscious decisions…\r\n\r\nAnd the same system I now teach inside Artisan Lab.

    "body": "This is a longer one so strap in, bo.\r\n\r\nLet’s break down the popular online business models in 2025.\r\n\r\nHere are the main ones that come to mind:\r\n\r\n* Dropshipping\r\n* High ticket sales\r\n* Trading\r\n* “AI Copywriting”\r\n* “AI Automation”\r\n* Being a TikTok Shop creator\r\n* Aaaand Info Agency\r\n\r\nObviously I have a bias for the Info Agency, but I’ll be as\r\nobjective as possible here.\r\n\r\nRanking from worst to best:\r\n\r\nTrading takes the major L.\r\n\r\nIt’s a casino.\r\n\r\nI’ve met many of the trading influencers and they all made their\r\nmoney from the 2020 crypto bull run, selling info, or owning a\r\nprop firm.\r\n\r\nAlmost none of them are profitable traders.\r\n\r\nYou simply have to be world class to make money – but I will say\r\nthe upside is tremendous.\r\n\r\nIf you are 1/10,000 who becomes really good, it can and will make\r\nyou rich.\r\n\r\nBut there is a 99.9% chance you never get there and waste all\r\nyour money.\r\n\r\nDropshipping is my second worst on the list here.\r\n\r\nIt can work, but similar to trading, most eCom gurus made their\r\nmoney from courses.\r\n\r\nAnd the successful ones, nine times out of ten are running a\r\nblackhat MRR scam.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nMany skills to learn, low margins, excess variables outside of\r\nyour control.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nScales fast IF you crack it (most don’t) and has enterprise value\r\n(most won’t get there).\r\n\r\nTo be entirely fair – trading and dropshipping both have about as\r\nhigh of an upside as any other model on the list.\r\n\r\nBut they generally require more capital and higher business\r\nacumen.\r\n\r\nNext up, “AI Automation.”\r\n\r\nIt’s just SMMA repackaged with AI in the title.\r\n\r\nDecent for beginners because you’ll learn some core skills.\r\n\r\nBut I hope you’re ready to deal with shitty clients, constant\r\nchurn, and build a big team.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need dozens of clients to make real money and will have to\r\nwork with dentists, realtors, or some other industry you likely\r\nknow nothing about.\r\n\r\nIt can work, but it’s definitely a grind.\r\n\r\nNext, TikTok shop creator.\r\n\r\nIt was an infinite money glitch a year ago.\r\n\r\nAbsolute monkey buffoon retards were getting rich.\r\n\r\nBut the faucet has started to turn off.\r\n\r\nIt’s basically like playing the lottery now.\r\n\r\nIf you’re consistent, you make really good content, and you keep\r\niterating, eventually you’ll go viral and make money.\r\n\r\nMost will quit before that happens and I’ve also heard some\r\nnightmares about not getting paid out commissions.\r\n\r\nIt can be decent cash flow but it’s declining and you don’t learn\r\nany real valuable skills.\r\n\r\nMoving on, we’ve reached the top three:\r\n\r\nAI Copywriting, High Ticket Sales, and Info Agency.\r\n\r\n“AI Copywriting” is not a business model, it’s a skill.\r\n\r\nThe application of said skill determines how much money you make.\r\n\r\nSales is similar – get good, find a good offer and you’ll make\r\nsolid cash.\r\n\r\nBoth of these are incredible things to learn.\r\n\r\nBut they both end up pointing to the Info Agency model.\r\n\r\nLearn “AI Copywriting” – who are the best clients to work with?\r\n\r\nInfo sellers.\r\n\r\nLearn sales – who are you closing for?\r\n\r\nInfo sellers.\r\n\r\nSo why not skip the line?\r\n\r\nFuck being the copywriting intern.\r\n\r\nFuck closing leads for someone else’s offer.\r\n\r\nJust build the machine yourself.\r\n\r\nControl the funnel.\r\n\r\nControl the offer.\r\n\r\nControl the money.\r\n\r\nThat’s the Info Agency.\r\n\r\nIt’s the only model where:\r\n\r\n· You don’t need 20 clients to scale\r\n\r\n· You don’t need a ton of capital\r\n\r\n· You don’t need to sell \"AI lead gen\" to boomers\r\n\r\nAnd you can scale to $50k/mo+ with one Google folder, one system,\r\nand one client.\r\n\r\nIt’s not as sexy as some of the other models.\r\n\r\nBut it’s effective – if you’re willing to work.\r\n\r\nSo if you want to learn how to build one that doesn’t suck…\r\n\r\n​You know where to find me.

    "body": "“This car will be a Porsche 911 and I’ll have the top down,\r\ncruising around LA…”\r\n\r\nI said to the girl in the passenger seat of my Honda Civic.\r\n\r\nShe replied “And the girl next to you will probably be way hotter\r\nthan me.”\r\n\r\nI laughed but the voice in my head agreed. She was right.\r\n\r\nIt was early 2021.\r\n\r\nI’d just started my agency and decided I was gonna drop out of\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\nAll I wanted was freedom..\r\n\r\nAnd a 911…\r\n\r\nAnd a dozen girlfriends…\r\n\r\nAaand to never have to take orders from some skinny-fat fucktard.\r\n\r\nLol.\r\n\r\nI’d watched the show Californication a few too many times and I\r\nwas set.\r\n\r\nThat was gonna be my life.\r\n\r\nAbout two and half years later, it was – just swap LA for Miami.\r\n\r\nI have the top down in my nardo grey 911 Turbo.\r\n\r\nThe girl in my passenger seat is indeed hotter.\r\n\r\nAnd I’m going on my third consecutive $100k month.\r\n\r\nLife is good… at least from the outside.\r\n\r\nI hadn’t really thought this far ahead.\r\n\r\nLike, what happens when you actually get all the superficial shit\r\nthat you want?\r\n\r\nIt’s not quite the life you see on TV.\r\n\r\nThe scene you don’t see is the existential crisis you have when\r\nlooking at yourself in the mirror.\r\n\r\nYou realize the version of life you sold yourself isn’t the\r\nutopia you thought it’d be.\r\n\r\nYou’ve still got problems.\r\n\r\nThere’s still things you don’t wanna do.\r\n\r\nAnd you’re still you.\r\n\r\nNow you gotta figure out what your next goal is – and this time,\r\nmaybe dig a little deeper.\r\n\r\nSo I’m not telling you to not go after the more shallow stuff.\r\n\r\nActually, if you take a look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, it’s\r\nsort of a rite of passage.\r\n\r\nYour physiological needs (food, shelter, water) are covered.\r\n\r\nYour safety needs are next, then you move on to belongingness and\r\nlove…\r\n\r\nAnd finally your esteem needs – feeling of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nI’d climbed the ladder to this point, but I didn’t account for\r\nthe top ring.\r\n\r\nSelf-actualization.\r\n\r\nI began asking questions like:\r\n\r\nWho am I?\r\n\r\nWhat’s my deeper purpose?\r\n\r\nWas I led astray?\r\n\r\nI had to climb the superficial ladder to reach a point where I\r\ncould think on these clearly.\r\n\r\nAlthough it felt like a quarter life crisis…\r\n\r\nIt was the greatest gift I could give myself.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s something you owe to yourself.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, chase the car, the girl, and whatever else you fantasize\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nJust know that if you’re lucky enough to catch it, there’s a new\r\ngame waiting for you on the other side.\r\n\r\nA quieter one.\r\n\r\nWhere the scoreboard isn’t just revenue or the hotness of the\r\ngirl next to you.\r\n\r\nIt’s purpose.\r\n\r\nIt’s waking up and actually liking who you are when no one’s\r\nwatching.\r\n\r\nAnd funny enough…\r\n\r\nThat might be the real flex after all.\r\n\r\nIf that’s the direction you’re trying to head in, I can help you\r\nhere.

And sheep are so dumb that they follow\r\neach other off cliffs.\r\n\r\nI know that’s incredibly convenient for me to say considering I\r\nsell coaching (hence the pitch warning).\r\n\r\nBut I was once one of the idiot sheep.\r\n\r\nNow, I can’t name a single rich friend of mine who hasn’t paid\r\nfor information.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, here are some of the bigger things I’ve\r\ninvested in over the past few years:\r\n\r\nSMMA coaching: $5k (I spent all the money I had on it)\r\n\r\nHigh ticket sales coaching: $2k\r\n\r\nJeremy Haynes Inner Circle: I’ve been paying him for over 2.5\r\nyears. I don’t want to do the math, but it’s close to six\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nIman Gadzhi’s 8FL: $18k\r\n\r\n1-1 coaching: $10k ++\r\n\r\nI’m definitely forgetting a handful of others, but there’s my\r\ndiploma.\r\n\r\nNot once have I felt ripped off, even when I didn’t end up\r\nutilizing much of a program.\r\n\r\nBecause you're not just buying information -- you're bullying\r\nyourself into an identity shift.\r\n\r\nI don’t know if I would’ve ever ‘made it’ online without doing\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nWhen you start paying for info, it's scary.\r\n\r\nThe online cattle love to tell you that all courses are scams.\r\n\r\nThey comment “nice try Diddy” and “put the fries in the bag.”\r\n\r\nYour family members and friends will think you’re involved in a\r\npyramid scheme.\r\n\r\nBut to the universe – and to yourself…\r\n\r\nIt’s a declaration of change.\r\n\r\nAs you type your card info into a Whop checkout page, as some\r\nsweaty 19 year old closer prays you don't leave the zoom call…\r\n\r\nA part of your soul becomes free.\r\n\r\nYou’ll feel a rush of anxiety and excitement.\r\n\r\nYou went against what 95% of people believe to be the norm.\r\n\r\nYou bet on yourself and spent an uncomfortable amount of money to\r\nsolidify that commitment.

Lol.\r\n\r\nBut even if you did, it’ll make for a good story.\r\n\r\nBecause now you’re in the arena.\r\n\r\nIt takes courage to reject the opinion of the masses – the same\r\nway it takes courage to build a successful business.\r\n\r\nSo, that concludes my indirect pitch.\r\n\r\n​Buy info, retard friend.

    "body": "“And then what?”\r\n\r\nThat simple question can be the difference between prosperity and\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nIt can lead you to potential problems before anyone else finds\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf you solve those problems, you might get rich.\r\n\r\nBut most people never think deeply enough to consider second\r\norder consequences.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example…\r\n\r\nFirst-order consequence:\r\n\r\n“This girl is hot. I want to date her.”\r\n\r\nSecond-order consequence:\r\n\r\n“She keyed my car, stole my Rolex and threw a chair off my\r\nbalcony.”\r\n\r\nIf you considered the second order consequence from the\r\nbeginning, you probably wouldn’t have made decision number one.\r\n\r\nMake sense?\r\n\r\nCool.\r\n\r\nThe same principle applies to business, especially with AI.\r\n\r\nHold on now, don't click off yet – I know you’re probably sick of\r\nthose two letters.\r\n\r\nMost agency owners, copywriters, and marketers are thinking…\r\n\r\n“Oh this is really cool, AI will do my work for me hurr durr.”\r\n\r\nAnd what’s the reaction to this?\r\n\r\nTheir clients realize they don’t need them.\r\n\r\nLow skill, basic service providers get replaced.\r\n\r\nBut this doesn’t mean you’re doomed…\r\n\r\nBecause high level service providers become indispensable.\r\n\r\nAn online coach (or really any business owner) doesn’t need\r\ndoers.\r\n\r\nThey need thinkers who can identify bottlenecks, strategize, and\r\nsteer the ship…\r\n\r\nWhile leveraging AI to improve efficiency, quality, and\r\neverything in between.\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, this means…\r\n\r\nInformation gets commoditized.\r\n\r\nEveryone will have the same tools.\r\n\r\n“I can build your funnel” is not a MOAT.\r\n\r\nAnd differentiation comes through thinking, experience, and\r\ncontext.\r\n\r\nPeople who understand psychology, systems, and nuances will use\r\nAI to multiply their impact.\r\n\r\nEveryone else will get drowned out.\r\n\r\nPricing power shifts to those who own outcomes, not just provide\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nImagine you build and manage the entire back-end of a $200k/month\r\ninfo biz.\r\n\r\nYou track KPIs, manage the team, improve conversions, and build\r\nthe whole system.\r\n\r\nYou’re not an expense, you’re a partner.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s why they’ll pay you $40k/mo, instead of $2k/mo.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the “AI agency, copywriter and arbitrageurs ” are\r\nfighting over scraps, praying someone throws them a $1,500 bone.\r\n\r\nAll the tools are accessible now. The difference is the\r\napplication and positioning.\r\n\r\nIf you can tie yourself to revenue, AI becomes your leverage not\r\nyour replacement.\r\n\r\n​Go here if you wanna stay ahead of the curve.

    "body": "Good morning, happy Monday.\r\n\r\nLet’s talk about the “trust recession.”\r\n\r\nYou’ve probably heard marketers throw this term around recently.\r\n\r\nConsumers are more skeptical than ever and there’s data to back\r\nit up.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, it seems obvious as to why.\r\n\r\nRemember the “automation” phase a few years ago?\r\n\r\nPeople started slinging “DFY passive income streams” for\r\nmulti-five figures a pop.\r\n\r\nImagine you’re a depressed middle aged man named Jerry.\r\n\r\nYou live paycheck to paycheck in Gary, Indiana with your 248lb\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nOn a random Tuesday night, you’re scrolling through Instagram.\r\n\r\nYou see a 30-second ad from a tattooed man, draped in Chrome\r\nHearts standing in front of a Huracan.\r\n\r\nHe says “we’ll build you an Amazon store and guarantee $15k/mo in\r\n90 days!”\r\n\r\nYou’re hooked.\r\n\r\nYou get on a sales call with some 19-year-old kid who convinces\r\nyou to take out a loan.\r\n\r\nAfter spending $40k that you don’t have, 90 days later you’ve\r\nmade nothing and can’t get a hold of the automation company.\r\n\r\nNo shit there’s a trust recession!\r\n\r\nThousands of people, like our friend Jerry, are now in\r\ngenerational debt.\r\n\r\nRightfully so, events like this have given online coaching a bad\r\nrap.\r\n\r\nBut I still believe it’s one of the most ethical and impactful\r\nbusinesses…\r\n\r\n*If you do it the right way* (most don’t).\r\n\r\nWhen there’s something you want to master, having a coach makes\r\nit infinitely easier.\r\n\r\nSomeone taught you how to drive.\r\n\r\nSomeone taught you how to play an instrument.\r\n\r\nSomeone taught you how to shoot a jump shot.\r\n\r\nYou could’ve figured all of these things out on your own, but\r\nthat’d be illogical.\r\n\r\nIt would take you exponentially longer, and you know that.\r\n\r\nSo, you take a shortcut – you get help from someone who’s done\r\nwhat you’re trying to do.\r\n\r\nMaking money is no different.\r\n\r\nOver the past year I’ve invested close to six figures to learn\r\nfrom people like Jeremy Haynes, William Brown, Taylor Allan and\r\nIman Gadzhi.\r\n\r\nCould I learn everything they’ve taught me through Youtube plus\r\ntrial and error?\r\n\r\nMaybe.\r\n\r\nBut why would I take the longer road, when an express lane is\r\navailable?\r\n\r\nThat’s what idiots do. And I don’t consider myself an idiot.\r\n\r\nSo bo, I’m imploring you to get coaching.\r\n\r\nWhether it’s from me or someone else, I’m pitching you for your\r\nsake.\r\n\r\n​Go here and buy this.

Set precise goals.\r\n\r\n“Land one client on a 20% rev share, get them to $100k/mo.”\r\n\r\n2. Reverse engineer it.\r\n\r\nHow many outbound messages do I need to send daily to get a\r\nclient?\r\n\r\n3. Execute.\r\n\r\nActually do it.\r\n\r\nThere’s your spiritual alignment manifestation guru guide – no\r\ncrystals required.\r\n\r\nJust set a goal, make a plan, and do the work.\r\n\r\nIf you want to manifest $20k/month without becoming a hippy, join\r\nme here.

    "body": "I filed my first ever dispute yesterday.\r\n\r\nAfter 24 years on this beautiful Earth, I finally had to do it.\r\n\r\nHere’s what happened:\r\n\r\nOn our way to the Hamptons, we had a driver take us from NYC to\r\nMontauk.\r\n\r\nHe showed up on time and his car was clean…\r\n\r\nBut the second I got in his black suburban, I regretted it.\r\n\r\nThis fucker smelled like he’d just eaten a bowl of curry and ran\r\na marathon to 7/11, where he then bought a bag of beef jerky.\r\n\r\nMy shirt was over my nose and I had the window open for the\r\nmajority of the ride.\r\n\r\nIt was still torture – I wouldn’t even wish such a thing on\r\nGeorge (my enemy from previous emails if you remember that dork).\r\n\r\nThat said, at least he got us there safely.\r\n\r\nI didn’t chargeback on the guy just because he smelled like a\r\nmath convention.\r\n\r\nBut that ride left a bad smell in my nose.\r\n\r\nSo on the way back, I decided we’d take a helicopter to NYC and\r\nthen catch our flight at JFK.\r\n\r\nIt was about 10x the price but 1/5th of the time and had a lower\r\nlikelihood of a smelly driver.\r\n\r\nWorth every penny in my humble opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of our flight, I got an email from the helicopter\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIt said if we had any luggage over 25 lbs, we’d have to schedule\r\na car service.\r\n\r\nThe only way to do so was to call them.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, why was I not prompted to do this until 3 hours\r\nbefore we’re scheduled to leave?\r\n\r\nWhatever.\r\n\r\nI give them a call, the guy tells me the bags might not arrive on\r\ntime, so he’d have to check and call me back.\r\n\r\nWe go back and forth for the next hour as he gives me a dozen\r\ndifferent answers.\r\n\r\nBasically it’d be $500 to send the luggage to the airport for us\r\nand he was unsure if it would arrive on time for our flight.\r\n\r\nFinally, I’m fed up so I told him to cancel it and I booked a\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry sir, your flight is non-refundable.”\r\n\r\nI end up talking to his supervisor, go back and forth, they won’t\r\nbudge, and basically tell me to get fucked.\r\n\r\nSo we didn’t take the $5,000 helicopter and now it’s in Amex’s\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nIt felt kind of cool clicking the dispute charge button.\r\n\r\nNow I understand what it’s like to be poor.\r\n\r\nIf I win, it’s a free $5k, if I lose, I’ll have forgotten about\r\nit by the time they make a decision.\r\n\r\nI guess there’s no lesson in here for you today, I just wanted to\r\ntell you that I’m now a proud member of the dispute club.\r\n\r\nLater,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

I’ve generated roughly $100k for my clients, left my job in\r\nthe Australian Navy, and now I’m traveling the world... Hands\r\ndown best community in the info space.\" – Ellis Deakin\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n* \"I started at $3K/mo. Hit $15K/mo in my 4th month. Just signed\r\nsomeone who did $1.6M last month. Haven’t done outreach in a\r\nmonth and probably never will again.\" – Dominic Morrell\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n* \"Going from $7K/mo to my first $17K/mo in 3 months of joining.\"\r\n– Khesraw Gulestani\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n* \"Ben’s coaching reshaped how I thought about business. I went\r\nfrom charging $500 per client to $7K+ upfront—and I actually own\r\nequity in a client business now.\" – Adam Wieczorek\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n* \"Last month my main client did $15K. On a 50% rev share, I took\r\nhome $7.5K—and it’s growing. I’ve leveraged that case study to\r\nland more clients. Artisan Lab gave me the confidence to go full\r\ngas.\" – Lloyd Johnsrud\r\n\r\nIf there’s one thing I’ve learned this year, it’s that change can\r\nhappen fast…\r\n\r\nFor the right person.\r\n\r\nIf you have a bit of foundation underneath you, all you need is\r\nalignment.\r\n\r\nEnvironment + skill + pressure = results.\r\n\r\nThat’s the formula.\r\n\r\nIf you’re already in motion, all you need is the right room and\r\nthe right model.

Gulp.\r\n\r\n“Uhh ye… yeah I’m working man” I respond.\r\n\r\nWrong answer.\r\n\r\nYou can’t do that with him.\r\n\r\nIf you try to virtue signal, he sees that as a personal attack in\r\nhis “get richer\" culture.\r\n\r\nFor the next 5-10 minutes, this guy just goes in on me (pause).\r\n\r\n“You’ve been making the same amount of money for two fucking\r\nyears!”\r\n\r\nI honestly don’t remember much else of what he said because I\r\nthink my brain categorized this as a traumatic event.\r\n\r\nBut I know it was all out of love.\r\n\r\nOr maybe disgust.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, he messaged me and said:\r\n\r\n“Send me the reasons you’d want the revenue to grow. You’re sold\r\non current reasons to stay where you’re at for perspective to\r\nreflect on.”\r\n\r\nI started thinking.\r\n\r\n“What would I actually do with 3x the money?” I considered.\r\n\r\nI made a list.\r\n\r\nThe first things on there were superficial lifestyle upgrades.\r\n\r\nSecond were long term investing goals.\r\n\r\nAnd third were more personal desires.\r\n\r\nI sent them to Jeremy and he replied, “If you don’t see a lift in\r\nproductivity and revenue, you’ll know you don’t care about these\r\nthings listed.”\r\n\r\nOver the following three months, I’ve kept this list top of mind.\r\n\r\nMy income has grown, I’ve seized new opportunities, and have felt\r\nmore in control.\r\n\r\nSo bo, I encourage you to ask yourself the same question…\r\n\r\nWhy do you want to make more money?\r\n\r\nGet crystal clear on this and write down a list.\r\n\r\nThese reasons should provoke emotion when you think about them.\r\n\r\nAnd next time you don’t feel like doing something you know you\r\nshould, take a look at that list.\r\n\r\nThere’s the advice I had to get yelled at for.\r\n\r\nIf you want more lessons from me that I learned the hard way…\r\n\r\n​Join me here.

Just sending a message\r\nyour way to say how cool it is seeing you grow. You’re crushing\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThis was from Mike, a basketball shooting coach who I worked with\r\na few years ago.\r\n\r\nHe was one of my first few info clients.\r\n\r\nI built a low ticket ascension funnel for him in March, 2022 and\r\nran ads for a handful of months after that.\r\n\r\nThat was a pivotal era in my journey.\r\n\r\nI’d begun dropping my local business clients and replacing them\r\nwith info guys.\r\n\r\nAt the start of that year, I had 14 local clients and somehow\r\nonly made $10k in January.\r\n\r\nBy June, I had five info clients and made $16k.\r\n\r\nThree of my clients were the top personal brands in online\r\nbasketball training.\r\n\r\nAnother was a YouTuber with over 500k subs who I used to be a fan\r\nof.\r\n\r\nAnd the last was one of my best friends at the time, selling a\r\nhigh ticket sales coaching offer.\r\n\r\nThis was phase one of my info business.\r\n\r\nI’ll refer to it as the “freelancer model.”\r\n\r\nI hadn't really tapped into rev shares yet, but I was charging\r\nhigher prices.\r\n\r\nI’d offer anything copy related – emails, ads, funnels, and\r\nVSL’s.\r\n\r\nBy October 2022, I got to $28k/mo this way.\r\n\r\nBut two months later, I found an even better model and entered\r\nphase two…\r\n\r\nThe “partner model.”\r\n\r\nThis is where I went all in on rev shares.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, my biggest client in December 2022 paid me\r\n$12,900.\r\n\r\nIn total, I made $31k that month with just six clients.\r\n\r\nCheck out what happened next:\r\n\r\n​\r\nThis new partner model got me as high as $124k profit in one\r\nmonth by the end of 2023.\r\n\r\nI’d have 5-8 clients at a time, who I’d typically become friends\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nUsing this model, I’d make between $80k-$120k/mo for the\r\nfollowing 12 months.\r\n\r\nSince then, I’ve entered phase 3 which I’ll call the “owner\r\nmodel.”\r\n\r\nAlthough I still have a few partner clients – I’ve built my own\r\noffer in Artisan Lab (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8ur65e8vghrhvn47g3ughvqxpmllf9hkmlpo/g3hnh5hmk9g8k4ir/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) and have majority share in a couple other offers.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a common progression.\r\n\r\nYou start off by offering anything you can – prove that you can\r\nbe trusted to not run away after someone gives you money.\r\n\r\nOnce you do that, you gain confidence in your skillset and start\r\ngetting a piece of the pie.\r\n\r\nYou now have a handful of clients on 10-30% rev shares.\r\n\r\nThis alone can get you to $100k/mo+ as it has for me and many\r\nmembers in AL.\r\n\r\nI’m not saying this is the only path.\r\n\r\nBut if you’re trying to escape the client hamster wheel and build\r\nsomething meaningful…\r\n\r\nThis is the one I’d bet on.\r\n\r\n* Start by doing great work for cheap\r\n* Build real skill and trust\r\n* Shift into higher-paying, higher-leverage partnerships\r\n* Eventually own the assets yourself\r\n\r\nThree years ago, I was charging as low as $1k/mo to write emails\r\nfor clients.\r\n\r\nNow I’ve had clients happily send $50k wires.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t wanna wait three years to figure this out the hard\r\nway…\r\n\r\n​Join me here.

Skill issue.\r\n\r\nI know I’m being harsh here and I empathize with you if you’re in\r\nthe trenches right now.\r\n\r\nBut when you take full ownership and fix your skill gap…\r\n\r\nYou’ll notice something strange start to happen – because skill\r\nisn’t the only variable.\r\n\r\nThere’s an invisible element that amplifies or blocks your\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIt’s your energy and your intention.\r\n\r\nPeople can just feel it.\r\n\r\nLet’s use outreach as an example.\r\n\r\nI’ve seen people come into Artisan Lab (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8ur65e8vghrhvn3memighvqxpmllf9hkmlpo/l2hehmhlz7qq4zb6/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) and get clients in their first week.\r\n\r\nOthers seem to struggle for months.\r\n\r\nThe interesting part is they’re using the same outreach\r\nstrategies.\r\n\r\nWhy does Person A send 10 outbound messages and get 3 clients\r\nwhen Person B sends 30 and gets 0 replies?\r\n\r\nIntention.\r\n\r\nPeople can tell whether you’re moving from confidence or\r\ndesperation.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re desperate, they can smell it through the screen.\r\n\r\nYou try to rush the process…\r\n\r\nYou get angry when people don’t reply.\r\n\r\nYou get bitter when you see others win.\r\n\r\nI had a basketball coach who’d always say “play fast, but not in\r\na hurry.”\r\n\r\nWhen you hurry, you get sloppy.\r\n\r\nYou forget about the details.\r\n\r\nYou try to run too fast and trip over your feet.\r\n\r\nBusiness is no different.\r\n\r\nDesperation makes the Universe say… “nah, you’re not ready yet.”\r\n\r\nMove with speed. But don’t rush.\r\n\r\nYour time is coming, you just have to stop scaring the money\r\nGods.\r\n\r\nIf you're ready, I can help you here.

Good.\r\n\r\nI've made over $2.5M doing this, and my students are crushing it\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nJace made $204k in one month from ONE client.\r\n\r\nDanny went from $5k/month with a bunch of agency clients to\r\n$150k/month with one AI Operating partnership.\r\n\r\nThe reason it works is because it's NOT just a business model.\r\nIt's a skill set that makes you irreplaceable.\r\n\r\nWith this skill set, you become the most valuable person in any\r\npersonal brand's business.\r\n\r\nThis not only allows you to charge revenue shares that pay you\r\nlike a business partner, but it also makes you recession-proof.\r\n\r\nAnd on the free class I'm gonna show you the exact steps you need\r\nto take to put yourself in this position.\r\n\r\nThis can turn you into a money printer. I promise.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, I was a lost frat bro with no direction in life.\r\n\r\nMaking $5k per month sounded like a pipedream.\r\n\r\nI figured the successful people online were either scammers or\r\nthey were smarter than me.\r\n\r\nBut I started taking action, I built my skill set, and now I'm\r\nhere in my Miami penthouse with my dream car.\r\n\r\nAnd I can tell you with 100% certainty, I am no smarter than you.\r\nI've simply made a series of good decisions that have resulted in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nAnd you, b, made a good decision by signing up for the free\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nBut the next decision you have to make is to show up.\r\n\r\nJuly 23rd, 7pm EST.\r\n\r\nSave this link –\r\nhttps://event.webinarjam.com/go/live/3/6rv7mh7fgs2s6 (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/v8ur65e8vghmuxv38elcghvqxpmllf9hkmlpo/08hwh9h2kn632ehl/aHR0cHM6Ly9ldmVudC53ZWJpbmFyamFtLmNvbS9nby9saXZlLzMvNnJ2N21oN2ZnczJzNg==\r\n)​\r\n\r\nAnd tell your girl she's on her own for dinner because you have\r\nto get rich.\r\n\r\nI promise you won't regret spending your night learning from me.\r\n\r\nExcited to help you grow,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

And just\r\none month later, he made over $90k.\r\n\r\nBut here’s where it gets absolutely insane…\r\n\r\nLast month, Jace made $204k. From ONE client.\r\n\r\n​\r\nNow this isn’t like dropshipping or Amazon FBA where you take\r\nhome 10% of that.\r\n\r\nThis is a high-margin, cash flow business where you’re keeping\r\n60-80% of what you bring in.\r\n\r\nHe now has a few clients, is getting insane results for them, and\r\nhas built a team around himself to scale.\r\n\r\nJace got here by mastering a few key things:\r\n\r\n1. Finding the right clients (info-product businesses with\r\nexisting traffic)\r\n\r\n2. Structuring profitable rev share deals\r\n\r\n3. Building a predictable system that scales\r\n\r\nAnd obviously – working really fucking hard.\r\n\r\nHe went from making roughly $120k per year to over a MILLION\r\nDOLLARS per year in 7 months.\r\n\r\nThis is what I mean when I say AI Operating is replacing\r\ntraditional agencies.\r\n\r\nWhy stack $2k retainers when you can get 30-40% of a\r\nmillion-dollar launch?\r\n\r\nOn the webinar, I’ll break down exactly how Jace (and dozens of\r\nother students) made this transition from grinding for scraps to\r\nlanding these massive revenue share deals.\r\n\r\nJuly 23rd, 7pm EST.\r\n\r\nDon’t miss it,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. Now I can’t promise you the same results as Jace because\r\nfrankly, his results are insane and he’s a maniac (in a good\r\nway).\r\n\r\nBut if you put in the effort and follow the same principles, it’d\r\nbe reasonable to assume you can achieve a fraction of his\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nAnd even a fraction would completely transform most people’s\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/d0u9zn358qsmu4owr5gtmhzpvrq44clhndgov\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/d0u9zn358qsmu4owr5gtmhzpvrq44clhndgov\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

If you\r\nwant more coaching, here’s an offer.”\r\n\r\nWe pitch… and nobody buys.\r\n\r\nI’m thinking, “did Jason Fladlien lie to me? Does this shit not\r\nactually work?”\r\n\r\nAnd then I see a few messages in the chat.\r\n\r\n“It won’t let me buy.”\r\n\r\n“It says purchase invalid.”\r\n\r\nI test a payment myself. It doesn’t work.\r\n\r\nAfter sending a threat to Russel Brunson and his family, I\r\nreplace our Clickfunnels link with a direct checkout Stripe link.\r\n\r\nThe money starts coming in.\r\n\r\n$5k…$10k…$20k…$40k.\r\n\r\nIt just spawned out of thin air.\r\n\r\nThat’s when I knew I stumbled into something special.\r\n\r\nWe started running weekly webinars.\r\n\r\nI pulled the strings on the backend, and my client put on a show\r\neach week.\r\n\r\nAlthough I only had a 10% rev share, I made $12,900 from that one\r\nclient in December 2022.\r\n\r\nThat’s when it clicked.\r\n\r\nWhy would I try to get a bunch of clients, when I can focus on\r\nscaling with a few?\r\n\r\nSince then, I’ve built webinar funnels that generated up to $600k\r\nin a week and got me paid handsomely from my rev share.\r\n\r\nNot because I’m special…\r\n\r\nBut because I found a system that works.\r\n\r\nThis Wednesday (July 23) at 7pm EST, I’ll be showing you that\r\nsystem…\r\n\r\nOn a free live webinar :)\r\n\r\n​How To Make $20,000+/Month From ONE Client Using AI Operating.

Give me 20% of whatever we make together.\"\r\n\r\nIt's a no-brainer for them.\r\n\r\nThey get their life back and can focus on what they're actually\r\ngood at.\r\n\r\nYou get paid like a business partner without having to be on\r\ncamera or build an audience from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis is called \"attention hijacking\" and it's the core of AI\r\nOperating.\r\n\r\nInstead of spending 3-5 years trying to become the next guru (and\r\nprobably failing), you partner with existing gurus and make guru\r\nmoney without being the face.\r\n\r\nWay smarter, way faster, way more profitable, and you don't have\r\nto deal with internet trolls commenting on your posts.\r\n\r\nI'll show you exactly how to do this on the webinar.\r\n\r\nSee you on July 23rd at 7pm EST,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/38umv9xlk7uduo29vv0brh47dzonnh7hr3x6l\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/38umv9xlk7uduo29vv0brh47dzonnh7hr3x6l\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

Nearly everyone goes through a phase\r\nwhere they’re in a situationship with eight different businesses.\r\n\r\nSomehow you convince yourself that they’re all mid or not “wifey\r\nmaterial.”\r\n\r\nSo you refuse to commit to any one of them and proclaim every\r\nbusiness is a whore!\r\n\r\nThe other day, I met an Uber driver with possibly the worst case\r\nof shiny object syndrome I’d ever seen.\r\n\r\nFirst he told me about his dropshipping business where he sold\r\nDonald Trump t-shirts.\r\n\r\nThen his “tinder for injury lawyers.”\r\n\r\nThen his contracting business.\r\n\r\nThen his AI only fans agency.\r\n\r\nThen he showed me a demo account where he allegedly turned $1k\r\ninto $10m.\r\n\r\nOh, and then he asked me for $100k so he could do it with real\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nI politely declined.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, this guy actually seemed pretty intelligent.\r\n\r\nHe showed me the websites he built for each business and they\r\nwere clean.\r\n\r\nHis ideas were thorough and it’s clear he was doing his research…\r\n\r\nToo much research.\r\n\r\nYou can convince yourself any business is better than what you’re\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nThey all look sexy from afar.\r\n\r\nBut one day, you’ll wake up next to it and see it without makeup.\r\n\r\nAnd only then will you realize it’s been using Facetune and AI\r\nfilters.\r\n\r\nYou’ll find the shortcut once you stop looking for it.\r\n\r\nYou commit.

I thought this was gonna be easy.”\r\n* Valley of despair - “Maybe I’m not cut out for this… Or maybe I\r\njust need to try a different business model. Yes, that’s it! I’m\r\ngonna be an AI Fighter Jet pilot.”\r\n* Informed optimism - “Nah, I’m gonna stick this out. I know\r\nit’ll be difficult but I can do it.”\r\n* Success and fulfillment - “Hello, MTV welcome to my Penthouse.”\r\n\r\nHere’s why I’m telling you this 48 hours before our webinar…\r\n\r\nOne of my Artisan Lab members, Brady, made $250,000 from one\r\nclient in one month.\r\n\r\nYes, you read that right.\r\n\r\nAfter we did his interview, he told me that he almost quit a year\r\nago.\r\n\r\nHe was grinding, but making no money and fell deep into the\r\nvalley of despair.\r\n\r\nAround that time, I made a YouTube video about the emotional\r\ncycle of change.\r\n\r\nHe said that video convinced him to keep pushing…\r\n\r\nFast forward just one year, and he’s hitting six figure months.\r\n\r\nBy signing up for this AI Operating webinar, you’ve already moved\r\ninto stage 4 - informed optimism.\r\n\r\nYou’ve decided to learn the model that’s actually working instead\r\nof jumping to another shiny object.\r\n\r\nDon’t let yourself slip back into the valley of despair now.\r\n\r\nShow up in 48 hours and get the system that can change\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nJuly 23rd at 7pm EST -\r\nhttps://event.webinarjam.com/go/live/3/6rv7mh7fgs2s6 (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403s7u5pqk8ouxh64drl77a5hmzg69/kkhmh6hn3orz58sl/aHR0cHM6Ly9ldmVudC53ZWJpbmFyamFtLmNvbS9nby9saXZlLzMvNnJ2N21oN2ZnczJzNg==\r\n)​\r\n\r\nSee you there,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403s7u5pqk8ouxh64drl77a5hmzg69\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403s7u5pqk8ouxh64drl77a5hmzg69\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

    "body": "I've got one more story for you before tomorrows webinar...\r\n\r\nOne of my best friends is this 21 year old kid named Phillip.\r\n\r\nI originally met him because he stalked me, sent me a dollar on\r\nVenmo, and I sent him $1,000 back.\r\n\r\nHe was a stranger at the time.\r\n\r\nFast forward a couple years and he lives a dozen floors below me\r\nin Miami.\r\n\r\nFor the past year or so, he’s been closing and managing the sales\r\nteam for a former client of mine.\r\n\r\nHe’s made great money doing it and has helped the business scale.\r\n\r\nBut he ran into an issue…\r\n\r\nOver half of his income came from him personally closing deals.\r\n\r\nMeaning if he wanted to continue making the same amount of money,\r\nhe had to be on zoom for the majority of each day.\r\n\r\nNearly anyone would get exhausted after spending the better half\r\nof the past year on calls.\r\n\r\nSo, he decided to take a step back.\r\n\r\nHis goal? Get off sales calls and transition into something with\r\nmore leverage.\r\n\r\nThat meant he’d take a pay cut.\r\n\r\nAnd if he wanted to even cover living expenses for the next month\r\nhe’d have to go get clients.\r\n\r\nBut as Plato said, “Eh, fuck it.”\r\n\r\nOr maybe it was “Necessity is the mother of invention.”\r\n\r\nThat’s when I taught him the AI Operating model.\r\n\r\nInstead of being stuck on calls all day, he could partner with\r\npersonal brands, handle their entire backend using AI, and get\r\nrevenue shares.\r\n\r\nPhillip’s AI Operating business was born and here’s what happened\r\nnext:\r\n\r\nHe hit $100k in a month with just 3 clients.\r\n\r\n​\r\nSix months ago, he was making $30k/month but working 12+ hours a\r\nday, basically living on Zoom calls like a prisoner.\r\n\r\nNow he makes almost 3x more working half the time and actually\r\nhas a life outside of his laptop.\r\n\r\nAaand the only difference is...\r\n\r\nHe learned the AI Operating model I’m teaching on tomorrow’s\r\nwebinar.\r\n\r\nHe stopped trading time for money and started getting rev shares\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nThis is the power of what I’ll show you tomorrow.\r\n\r\nYou’re not selling your time, you’re selling your systems.\r\n\r\nYou build it once, it runs forever, and you get paid like you own\r\npart of the business.\r\n\r\nWebinar Details:​\r\n📅 Tomorrow (July 23rd) at 7pm EST\r\n🔗 https://event.webinarjam.com/go/live/3/6rv7mh7fgs2s6 (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zupx8r403s7u5pqk4osxh64drl77a5hmzg69/3ohphkh3n8o7eoar/aHR0cHM6Ly9ldmVudC53ZWJpbmFyamFtLmNvbS9nby9saXZlLzMvNnJ2N21oN2ZnczJzNg==\r\n)​\r\n⏰ 90 minutes + Q&A\r\n\r\nDon’t miss it,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

It tensed up and I had a\r\ntension headache all day.\r\n\r\nPlus I was stressed because I’d been procrastinating my webinar\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nTuesday was supposed to be the day I’d finally get it done.\r\n\r\nBut looking at the computer screen hurt my eyes.\r\n\r\nSo instead of doing anything productive, I laid on the floor for\r\nthe majority of the day.\r\n\r\nWhen webby day rolled around, I had 10% of my slides ready.\r\n\r\nPlus I still had to set up all the automations, reminders, etc.\r\n\r\nFuck me.\r\n\r\nBut I powered through it.\r\n\r\nI got up at 5am, put on David Goggins playlist and got everything\r\ndone by 9am.\r\n\r\nJust kidding, lol.\r\n\r\nI woke up around 8, and leisurely got ready.\r\n\r\nStill I procrastinated the slides, and started with the backend\r\ntasks that needed to be set up.\r\n\r\nAround 1pm (6 hours before I went live) I opened my Google\r\nPresentation.\r\n\r\nThe good news was I had 27 slides already completed.\r\n\r\nThe bad news was that I ended up with 284 slides.\r\n\r\nBut I started cooking.\r\n\r\nI recently saw a video of Hunter Biden explaining what it’s like\r\nto be on crack – and now I fully understand it.\r\n\r\nAlthough I wasn’t on crack (to be clear), I was hearing colors\r\nand seeing sounds.\r\n\r\nThe words for each slide came to me effortlessly.\r\n\r\nBy 6:30pm EST (30 minutes before) I’d finished 90%.\r\n\r\nThe pitch was the only thing I didn’t finish because I wanted to\r\nquickly review the training.\r\n\r\nSo I said “fuck it” and just winged the pitch.\r\n\r\nAnd today, I’m really glad I didn’t cancel it.\r\n\r\nI had a great time, people seemed to love it, and hopefully we’ll\r\nget many new Artisan Lab (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8uvdq4g0psqh64gq8zivhq2dg8rrfohrzeql/9qhzhnhd2kz3g7t9/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) members and change a lot of lives.\r\n\r\nIf you were there, thanks for coming.\r\n\r\nIf you weren’t, I’ll run it back at some point down the line\r\nbecause I’m now addicted to crack.\r\n\r\nEither way, you can get rich with me here.

    "body": "In yesterday's email, we talked about procrastination.\r\n\r\nI told you how I waited until the last minute to make slides for\r\nWednesday's webinar.\r\n\r\nBut what I didn’t tell you about were the three months of\r\nprocrastination before that.\r\n\r\nIn April, I decided I’d start running webinars.\r\n\r\nI told myself I’ll get it set up “sometime in the near future.”\r\n\r\nThose five words signify something that’ll never happen.\r\n\r\nThere’s some 63 year old out there still waiting to start his\r\nSMMA after seeing a Tai Lopez ad ten years ago.\r\n\r\n“Sometime in the near future,” he continues to say.\r\n\r\nWhenever I catch myself continually delaying an action, I\r\neventually reach a breaking point.\r\n\r\nI figuratively punch myself in the face for being an idiot.\r\n\r\nAnd then I start moving.\r\n\r\nExactly two weeks ago today, I reached that point.\r\n\r\nI was on my morning walk to get coffee and I opened a newsletter\r\nemail from a mentor of mine, Taylor Allan.\r\n\r\nHe wrote about “biting off more than you can chew” and forcing\r\nyourself to figure it out.\r\n\r\nYou’ll quickly realize you’re capable of more than you thought.\r\n\r\nAnd at the end of the email, he gave some examples.\r\n\r\nOne of which, was:\r\n\r\n“Organize a launch before you’ve built the product — with a date,\r\na sales page, and people expecting delivery — and you will find a\r\nway to build it in time.”\r\n\r\nThat clicked.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home from the coffee shop, I picked the date for the\r\nwebinar.\r\n\r\nTwo days later I had the sign up page, backend set up, and promo\r\nvideos ready.\r\n\r\nI started promoting it a week out.\r\n\r\nAnd finally…\r\n\r\nI forced myself to build the presentation (at the very last\r\nminute).\r\n\r\nSo I guess this is my attempt to do for you, what Taylor’s email\r\ndid for me.\r\n\r\nHere are a few ideas for you:\r\n\r\n- Start doing outreach and book a sales call before you know how\r\nto fulfill.\r\n\r\n- Make a reservation for two at the nicest restaurant in your\r\ncity tonight and find a 10 to go with you.\r\n\r\n- Buy a plane ticket and book a trip somewhere you’ve been\r\nwanting to go.\r\n\r\n- Apply for Artisan Lab, (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hn57rm6h6h9mqg344cnh4p03v/m2h7h5h3ngwrqxam/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) and you’ll feel the pressure to 10x your investment :)\r\n\r\nHope this motivates you to get moving.\r\n\r\nIf not, there’s always next year.\r\n\r\nHave a good weekend,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hn57rm6h6h9mqg344cnh4p03v\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/5qu8dq3lkes7hn57rm6h6h9mqg344cnh4p03v\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

    "body": "Good morning.\r\n\r\nYesterday I decided I want a Ferrari 488 Pista.\r\n\r\nI’d been trying to convince myself to want a McLaren 720s, but\r\nthey just look plasticy to me.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is, Pistas are around $600k.\r\n\r\nThat’s about double what I’d be comfortable spending right now.\r\n\r\nSo… I have to make more money.\r\n\r\nAfter this material awakening, I began thinking about how to do\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways to grow any high ticket service or coaching\r\nbusiness:\r\n\r\n1. Increase traffic\r\n\r\n2. Increase conversions\r\n\r\n3. Increase LTV\r\n\r\nAt first, traffic is the most important – without it, you don’t\r\nhave a business.\r\n\r\nBut conversions and LTV start to matter more once traffic is\r\nflowing.\r\n\r\nI recently helped a client launch from scratch.\r\n\r\nHe started posting short form content a few months ago and\r\nquickly gained traction.\r\n\r\nWe threw together a lead magnet, captured emails and nurtured\r\nthem through the list.\r\n\r\nAbout 60 days ago, we started selling.\r\n\r\nProspects go through a short VSL, fill out an application, and\r\nbook with our sales team.\r\n\r\nWe’re making some money, but our conversion rate sucks.\r\n\r\nThe leads are low intent, low trust, and just don’t seem to care\r\nenough about what we’re selling.\r\n\r\nThis is a good problem to have because it’s fairly easy to solve.\r\n\r\nMaybe the way we position the offer isn’t resonating.\r\n\r\nMaybe we’re selling to the wrong type of people.\r\n\r\nMaybe we simply need to bombard prospects with way more proof.\r\n\r\nFixing this is just a matter of tests and tweaks. Here’s a few\r\nI’m exploring:\r\n\r\n– Adjusting the pitch\r\n\r\n– Adding more proof to the funnel\r\n\r\n– Increasing touch points pre-call\r\n\r\n– Swapping to a webinar\r\n\r\n– Revising our DM setting flow\r\n\r\nMy job as a marketer/operator is to fuck with all of the above\r\nuntil numbers improve.\r\n\r\nOnce they do, we can allocate more attention and focus to the\r\nother two buckets.\r\n\r\nTo get more traffic, run ads and/or make more content.\r\n\r\nTo increase LTV, sell more expensive shit.\r\n\r\nIt’s quite simple.\r\n\r\nIf you see me post in a 488 Pista in the next few months, you’ll\r\nknow I found the solution.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t, I’m getting there.\r\n\r\n​Go here (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/e5uxd6r2vzs7hlkm687s8h8d3e022clh26gvn/8ghqhoho5pl9lzck/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) if you want my help in building and/or scaling your info\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nTalk tomorrow,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/e5uxd6r2vzs7hlkm687s8h8d3e022clh26gvn\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/e5uxd6r2vzs7hlkm687s8h8d3e022clh26gvn\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

And I made it as enjoyable as possible.\r\n\r\nI’m writing to you from a penthouse in Miami because of this.\r\n\r\nI have liquid 7 figures because of this.\r\n\r\nThe car I’ve wanted since I was 10 years old is in the garage\r\nbecause of this.\r\n\r\nI’m not bragging.\r\n\r\nBut I’m imploring you that success is no accident.\r\n\r\nWake up.\r\n\r\nYour problems will never fix themselves.\r\n\r\nYou’re too comfortable at your current standards.\r\n\r\nYou tell yourself you want to change but you do nothing about it.\r\n\r\nWhen are you gonna put your foot down and act, (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0u9zn358qs0hoqgegzfmhzn26244ilhndgov/3ohphkh3d7pr67br/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) you buffoon!\r\n\r\nDon’t wait until it’s too late.\r\n\r\nLove you,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/d0u9zn358qs0hoqgegzfmhzn26244ilhndgov\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/d0u9zn358qs0hoqgegzfmhzn26244ilhndgov\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

My business model was.\r\n\r\nThe Info Agency model became my loving home.\r\n\r\nMore leverage, fewer clients, and rev shares.\r\n\r\nPlus no risk of getting replaced by a freak named Deshuan.\r\n\r\n​Here’s your ticket to a better vehicle.

    "body": "It’s August 25th 2025.\r\n\r\nIT’S AUGUST 25TH 2025!\r\n\r\nThis year is flying by.\r\n\r\nExactly five years ago today I started my “sophomore” year of\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\n“Sophomore” is in quotes because it was really a continuation of\r\nmy freshman year based on credit hours.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a 1.1 GPA for a semester, I guess that really sets\r\nyou back.\r\n\r\nBut I knew I’d be out of there soon and mentally, I already was.\r\n\r\nI was only taking one class to keep my parents happy because it\r\nmeant I was still enrolled.\r\n\r\nThis gave me plenty of time to work on my “business.”\r\n\r\nWell, it wasn’t really a business yet but I was getting there.\r\n\r\nI was doing freelance videography, making about $1k per month —\r\nwhich was an interesting phase.\r\n\r\nThis was my “I finally found some direction but now I’m even more\r\nlost than I was before” era.\r\n\r\nBut in between bong rips and frat parties, I was grinding.\r\n\r\nThe only problem was that bong rips and frat parties were a\r\nfrequent occurrence, so I wasn’t growing very fast.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the year I was in peak shiny object syndrome form.\r\n\r\nBetween juggling a dozen situationships in college and a dozen\r\nmore in half-baked businesses, I was overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nI had a few videography clients, bought an SMMA course, bought a\r\nsales course, got an appointment setter role, and quit after a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nHere were my exact words from a journal entry on Jan 8, 2021:\r\n\r\n“Feeling a little defeated. More confused, and making less money\r\nthan I did prior. Ugh. Maybe this online biz thing isn’t for me…\r\nMaybe I was born to be a dreamer. Get stuck in the 9-5 with all\r\nthese big ideas that never come to fruition. Maybe. Or maybe I\r\njust need to commit to something.”\r\n\r\nThat last line was wise, young Ben.\r\n\r\nMy two main problems were:\r\n\r\n1. Although I was lost, life was still relatively comfortable. I\r\ndidn’t feel enough urgency because of this.\r\n\r\n2. I lacked internal conviction. This made me continually find\r\nproblems with each business model because in reality I didn’t\r\nbelieve in myself.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds at all familiar, congratulations.\r\n\r\nYou have entered the era that will likely determine the rest of\r\nyour life.\r\n\r\nNo pressure, b.\r\n\r\nLooking back, here’s what I did that got me through it…\r\n\r\nThe obvious answer is I finally picked one business model and\r\nstuck to it.\r\n\r\nBut it was deeper than that.\r\n\r\nI had to become the person capable of the success I wanted.\r\n\r\nSmall daily habits I adopted were a big reason I could do that.\r\n\r\nI journaled almost every day and treated each entry as a mini\r\nsparring session with myself.\r\n\r\nOn January 27th, 2021, about a month before I got my first SMMA\r\nclient, I wrote:\r\n\r\n“Be the person who is becoming the person you want to be, and you\r\nwill become the person you want to be.\r\n\r\nBe the average person who wants to become great in the future,\r\nand you will stay the average person who wants to become great in\r\nthe future.”\r\n\r\nThat first line might be hard to read, but here’s what I meant:\r\n\r\nThink like your future self, act like your future self, and\r\nyou’ll become them faster than you think.\r\n\r\nWhat habits do they have?\r\n\r\nHow would they act in the situation you’re currently in?\r\n\r\nGet a clear picture.\r\n\r\nAnd today, choose to act like that version of yourself you’re\r\naiming to become.\r\n\r\nOnly then, will reality begin to catch up.\r\n\r\nEventually you’ll look back at your frat-boy-self with a 1.1 GPA\r\nand laugh at how far you’ve come.\r\n\r\nBut only if you start today.

We had the barebones in place for everything.\r\n\r\nSince then, we’ve revised the VSL, the funnel cycled through\r\nclosers and setters, adjusted the pitch, the offer, and so on.\r\n\r\nNow our backend foundation is solid and scaling to six figure\r\nmonths is mostly a matter of more traffic.\r\n\r\nIf it sounds like I’m over simplifying it, I’m really not.\r\n\r\nAll you need is traffic, a funnel, and an offer.\r\n\r\nGod bless info.\r\n\r\nOkay I gotta get on this call – Go here to see how we spawn seven\r\nfigure info businesses from scratch.

    "body": "I’m in downtown Chicago, sitting in a coffee shop that doubles as\r\na bar.\r\n\r\nIt looks exactly how you’d imagine.\r\n\r\nDark walls, wooden tables, and barstools that look easy to pick\r\nup and swing at someone’s head.\r\n\r\nThey’re playing Mr. Blue Sky on the speaker. Forgotten banger.\r\n\r\nIt took me 22 minutes to get here, although it’s only a 3 minute\r\nwalk from my hotel.\r\n\r\nI asked the receptionist “What’s the best coffee shop around\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“Jründgen ven” she said.\r\n\r\nShe had a German(?) accent that seemed to only be thick when\r\npronouncing the name of the cafe.\r\n\r\nI mostly understood the rest of her directions but wasn’t really\r\npaying attention because I was trying to make out what Jrüdgen\r\nven was.\r\n\r\nShe said something about going to the left and taking an\r\nelevator. I think.\r\n\r\nDrunken Bean!\r\n\r\nThat’s what Jrüdgen ven means.\r\n\r\nOk easy enough, I’ll just put in my trusted google maps - no need\r\nfor Nazi directions.\r\n\r\n2 minutes later I was at Drunken Bean.\r\n\r\nWell, my phone said I was. But unless it was hidden inside a fire\r\nstation, the GPS was wrong.\r\n\r\nSo I just started walking aimlessly.\r\n\r\nI figured I’d either finally find the elusive little bean (pun\r\nintended) or I’d stumble into a different cafe.\r\n\r\nAfter 15 minutes, I was basically back where I started.\r\n\r\nJust as I was about to give up and Uber to a different cafe, I\r\nlooked to my right and saw…\r\n\r\nAn elevator.\r\n\r\nIt was practically glowing. Like when you find a gold scar in\r\nFortnite.\r\n\r\nI didn’t know where it would take me or why it was on the middle\r\nof the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nBut I knew I had to get in it.\r\n\r\nI put my faith in the elevator and finally a minute later the\r\nwords, “Iced latte with vanilla. Actually make it a double,\r\nbitch” came out of my mouth.\r\n\r\nSo as I sit here, trying to extrapolate a lesson from this heroic\r\njourney, here’s what I got for ya:\r\n\r\nJust move — even if you’re directionless.\r\n\r\nYour whole life was designed for you to think that you start with\r\na map.\r\n\r\nGo through grade school, pick a major, stay the course…\r\n\r\nInternship, entry level job, marry the chubby 4, live the same\r\nday for 30 years, retire, and die.\r\n\r\nSorry I’m being a harsh asshole.\r\n\r\nBut if that sounds as miserable to you as it does to me,\r\ndeveloping a high tolerance for uncertainty is your savior.\r\n\r\nIf you want to carve your own path, you must accept that 90% of\r\nthe time it’ll feel like you’re running through a dark forest\r\nwith a toothbrush as your defense weapon.\r\n\r\nYou’ll almost never be able to accurately predict what the next\r\nfew years of your life will look like.\r\n\r\nWhich is okay – as long as you’re in motion.\r\n\r\nJust keep walking, turning, looking…\r\n\r\nAnd eventually your golden elevator (\r\nhttps://click.kit-mail1.com/xmum20qvx9u6hpw25xoi5h2pd5dllanhv48px/m2h7h5h3ow5o4lsm/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) will appear.\r\n\r\nSee you at the Jründgen ven.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.kit-mail1.com/xmum20qvx9u6hpw25xoi5h2pd5dllanhv48px\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.kit-mail1.com/xmum20qvx9u6hpw25xoi5h2pd5dllanhv48px\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

Swishes only.”\r\n\r\nI think to myself “this mf crazy, I need a new trainer.”\r\n\r\nBut I keep shooting, now aiming only for nylon.\r\n\r\nThe ball hits the back of the rim and goes in. Doesn’t count.\r\n\r\nFront rim. Side rim. Rattles in off the glass.\r\n\r\nDoesn’t matter, I’m running.\r\n\r\n“This is ridiculous. I’m literally making these shots and still\r\nbeing forced to run,” I complain to myself.\r\n\r\nBut then something cool happens.\r\n\r\nI find the sweet spot and the ball stops hitting the rim.\r\n\r\nThe way I’m shooting feels different now.\r\n\r\nI’m no longer just aiming for the basket.\r\n\r\nI’m aiming for a very specific part of the back of the net.\r\n\r\nI’m conscious of exactly how the ball has to leave my fingertips.\r\n\r\nEverything is incredibly precise.\r\n\r\nI’ve reached a level of attention to detail and focus that I\r\nwasn’t accessing previously.\r\n\r\nThis is the difference between good and great.\r\n\r\nIt’s what keeps some business owners stuck at $10k, $50k, or\r\n$100k per month.\r\n\r\nIt’s what causes tens of thousands of dollars worth of leads to\r\nfall through the cracks in a sales process.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s what created the opportunity for me to make 7-figures as\r\na marketer for info-product businesses.\r\n\r\nI get paid to fill in the gaps.\r\n\r\nTo improve the copy, or the sales process, or the video script.\r\n\r\nI bring a new level of attention to minor details and make an\r\nextra 6 figures a month for my clients.\r\n\r\nThey pay me a percentage of it.\r\n\r\nThis is how you win as a service provider for coaching business.\r\n\r\nFind the broken piece(s) of their business.\r\n\r\nIdentify a solution using your critical thinking ability.\r\n\r\nGet paid.\r\n\r\nFor example if an usually low amount of leads end up on sales\r\ncalls, my job is to find the crack in the system.\r\n\r\nMaybe the email sequence sucks or there’s none at all.\r\n\r\nMaybe the leads aren’t getting dialed.\r\n\r\nMaybe the video sales letter is horrible.\r\n\r\nMaybe there’s a lack of congruence between the content and the\r\nmessaging on the funnel.\r\n\r\nWhatever the problem is, the way to make money is to identify and\r\nfix it.\r\n\r\nBoom, now you’re a valuable piece to any coaching business.\r\n\r\nYou’re turning good, into great.\r\n\r\n​Congrats, that’s how the money is made.​\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "I was playing catch with my phone yesterday.\r\n\r\nMy goal was to throw it as close as possible to the ceiling\r\nwithout touching it.\r\n\r\nI had the accuracy of prime Aaron Rodgers.\r\n\r\nWith each throw, I progressively got closer.\r\n\r\nThere had to be less than a centimeter of space between my phone\r\nand the drywall.\r\n\r\nAnd then…\r\n\r\nI put too much power on it.\r\n\r\nMy phone hit the ceiling and started wobbling down to me.\r\n\r\nIt was spinning as fast as it was falling.\r\n\r\nI reached out and got a finger on it but couldn’t reel it in (not\r\neven prime Odell Beckham Jr. could’ve caught it).\r\n\r\nIt hit the porcelain tile, bounced, and landed face down.\r\n\r\n“Finally! It’s gotta be broken,” I thought.\r\n\r\nI picked it up and looked at the screen.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, it was in perfect condition. Not a single crack\r\nor dent.\r\n\r\nI sighed, put it in my pocket and got back to work.\r\n\r\nI was hoping it was damaged because then I’d have to get a new\r\none.\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking, “Ben, I thought you were rich, can’t you\r\njust buy one?”\r\n\r\nThe money isn’t the issue.\r\n\r\nIt’s the friction that comes with it.\r\n\r\nGetting a new phone means transferring all my data.\r\n\r\nI know this can be simple, but what if something goes wrong?\r\n\r\nThat would mean I have to make a visit to one of my least\r\nfavorite establishments on Earth…\r\n\r\nThe Apple store.\r\n\r\nI just hate everything about it.\r\n\r\nThe lights, the people, the smell…\r\n\r\nI’d walk in, go up to one of the virgins at the “genius bar” and\r\nthey’d say…\r\n\r\n“Sir you need an appointment” under their COVID mask.\r\n\r\nThen I’d have to wait 30 minutes for the little genius to finish\r\nteaching a grandma how to take a photo.\r\n\r\nFinally, buddy would waddle over to me and say, “what’s the\r\nissue, pal?”\r\n\r\nThe first issue is my phone doesn’t work. The second issue is you\r\ncalling me “pal.”\r\n\r\nThen I’d wait for him to do whatever virgin witchcraft is\r\nnecessary to set up my phone, and finally I’d be outta there.\r\n\r\nThat’s just not an experience I’m willing to go through –\r\nespecially when my current phone is functional.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I was hoping it was broken.\r\n\r\nBecause only then, would the pain of doing nothing outweigh the\r\ncost of change.\r\n\r\nIn life, it’s pretty easy to be comfortable.\r\n\r\nEven if you’re fairly miserable in your current situation.\r\n\r\nIf you have food on the table, a girl above a 4 who lets you hit,\r\nand there’s football on TV…\r\n\r\nIt’s not that bad, right?\r\n\r\nSo despite the fact that you want to change, you’re not in enough\r\npain to sacrifice the comfort.\r\n\r\nSuch is life.\r\n\r\nThis is typically the part where we come to a resolution.\r\n\r\nI give you some advice that wraps it all up into a positive\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nBut today, the answer doesn’t come from me.\r\n\r\nIt comes from how much pain you’re willing to create for\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nMaybe that means you intentionally destroy your life.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps you just needed to throw on a David Goggins video.\r\n\r\nHope you can figure it out!\r\n\r\n​I’ll be here.

Put your phone in\r\nanother room – or lend it to a homeless man who’s instructed to\r\nonly give it back if you give him $100 each day.\r\n\r\n3. Understand that your negative thoughts are not reality. When\r\nyou take action instead of listening to them, they lose power\r\nover you (don’t be a pussy).\r\n\r\n4. Habits and rituals outweigh relying solely on willpower. Make\r\n“discipline” easy – give yourself a reward after completing tasks\r\n(i.e. after I send outreach, I will do crack).\r\n\r\n5. Focus on the feeling of accomplishment after completing\r\ndifficult tasks, not just the tasks themselves.\r\n\r\nBoom.\r\n\r\nTwo days after I gave him this advice, he said “Guys outreach is\r\nfking easy” and closed a new client:\r\n\r\n​\r\nIf you’re tired of breaking my record for most hours wasted in a\r\nday, go here and I’ll fix it with you inside Artisan Lab.

You’re down 17 with a\r\nminute 24 on the clock!” you yell, somehow not knowing they can’t\r\nhear you.\r\n\r\nAnd then, with 19 seconds left in the game, it happens.\r\n\r\nThe quarterback throws the ball across the middle to number 81\r\nfor 7 yards.\r\n\r\nIt’s a meaningless play, the clock runs out, and the Texans lose.\r\n\r\nBut it meant everything to you.\r\n\r\nThat single catch means you’re not only back to breakeven, but\r\nyou’re in the green!\r\n\r\nOne event made up for all of your losses.\r\n\r\nBusiness is the same way — especially in the beginning.\r\n\r\nMost days it’s just pain.\r\n\r\nOne loss after another, your hard work is unrewarded, you want to\r\nquit…\r\n\r\nBut then…\r\n\r\nAfter 3 months of sending outbound messages with no luck, you get\r\na banger client.\r\n\r\nAfter posting 150 videos that flop, you go viral and it explodes\r\nyour business.\r\n\r\nAfter approaching 7,321 women in the street, one finally doesn’t\r\nrun away.\r\n\r\nYou need to adopt the mindset of the addicted gambler.\r\n\r\nThey will not stop.\r\n\r\nThe hole will get deeper and deeper…\r\n\r\nUntil one day…\r\n\r\n​One win makes up for everything.

Still improbable.\r\n\r\nThen with just two minutes left in the game, Rome Odunze scored.\r\n\r\nOh shit.\r\n\r\nI’d sort of given up on the bet by halftime but it looks like it\r\nmight hit.\r\n\r\nThose two legs were the underdogs.\r\n\r\nThe bet with the highest statistical probability was the only one\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nWith just 5 seconds to go, Caleb Willliams is 17 yards shy of the\r\nmagic 219 number.\r\n\r\nSooo you’re saying there’s a chance…\r\n\r\nThe Bears have one play to go the length of the field.\r\n\r\nThey snap the ball, Williams throws for 8 yards.\r\n\r\nThe ball gets lateraled to a different player who runs for\r\nanother 13.\r\n\r\nThat’s 21 yards!\r\n\r\nGame over, parlay hits…\r\n\r\nRight?\r\n\r\nUhhh, no.\r\n\r\nOfficially, Caleb only gets credit for 8.\r\n\r\nLateral yards don’t count for passing stats.\r\n\r\nSo he finished the game with 210 yards.\r\n\r\nJust 9 short of the magic number that would’ve turned our $100\r\nbet into $1,200.\r\n\r\nThat’s the painful beauty of a parlay.\r\n\r\nBeing “close” yields you nothing means nothing.\r\n\r\nYou can’t carry any momentum into the next bet.\r\n\r\nBut in business, you can.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re nine yards short in business, it means you’re\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nYour outreach is sharper.\r\n\r\nYour content is starting to hit.\r\n\r\nYou’re stacking reps and getting closer to gold.\r\n\r\nEvery near miss is just proof that you’re on the right track.\r\n\r\nKeep going…\r\n\r\nAnd go here (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6h5ngxd0ilhokz6777i8hgk6z5/3ohphkh37oo567br/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) if you want me in your corner.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6h5ngxd0ilhokz6777i8hgk6z5\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/k0udqe8rwzs6h5ngxd0ilhokz6777i8hgk6z5\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

Or your\r\n“rich husband” turns into a guy that makes $105k/yr and loves to\r\nsay he makes six figures.\r\n\r\nYour dream of waking up to the sound of the waves crashing on the\r\nshore only happens 3 days a year. And you’re on vacation in\r\nMyrtle Beach, not Honolulu.\r\n\r\nI know this sounds a bit dramatic, but making compromises when it\r\ncomes to your desires is a slippery slope.\r\n\r\nYou need to be militant.\r\n\r\nYou need to be stubborn.\r\n\r\nYou need to aim for what you actually want.\r\n\r\nWhen others tell you to be reasonable, or when you begin to hear\r\na voice in your head negotiating with you, shut it out.\r\n\r\nI’d rather be an insane, unreasonable, stubborn asshole than a\r\nchubby balding middle aged man… in a COROLLA!\r\n\r\nDo not tolerate behavior that doesn’t align with your goals.\r\n\r\nWhen you make a plan, stick to it as if you are following orders\r\nfrom God.\r\n\r\nThere is no negotiating, there is no settling, and when you find\r\nyourself exchanging “great” for “good enough,” stop yourself.\r\n\r\nIf you compromise, I guess I’ll send you a postcard from\r\nHonolulu.\r\n\r\nThat’s basically the real thing isn’t it! LOL!\r\n\r\nNo. Stop.\r\n\r\nIt’s not the real thing. And a C8 isn’t a supercar. And fuck\r\nMrytle Beach.\r\n\r\nTheir rules and standards are meant to be broken.

Not for a greater purpose. But for me.\r\n\r\nI wanted to escape the inevitable future pain of mediocrity.\r\n\r\nIs that selfish? Sure.\r\n\r\nBut had I deluded myself into believing that I needed a stronger\r\n“why,” perhaps I never would’ve started.\r\n\r\nI could’ve rationalized, “I’m not motivated and I can’t work\r\nbecause my life is decent as it is.”\r\n\r\nDon’t let Simon Sinek (author of It Starts With Why) fool you.\r\n\r\nYour “why” can be ripping an SVJ through the Hollywood hills.\r\n\r\nYour “why” can be having the autonomy to wake up at noon every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nYour “why” can be club-hopping in Ibiza with a bunch of\r\nungrateful models.\r\n\r\nMy point is stop worrying about your fucking “why” and make\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nDo you want to be miserable?\r\n\r\nDo you want to be poor?\r\n\r\nDo you want to be an incel?\r\n\r\nNo?\r\n\r\nOkay! Then what the fuck else are you gonna do with your time?\r\nLol.\r\n\r\nEventually, your motivating factors will naturally evolve.\r\n\r\nOnce you check off the superficial desires, perhaps your focus\r\nwill shift to retiring your parents, setting up future\r\ngenerations, or saving the Goddamn turtles.\r\n\r\nBut right now, you probably don’t care much about any of that.\r\n\r\nIf you’re honest with yourself, you just don’t want to worry\r\nabout spending money.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s completely fine.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to find some moral justification to stay\r\nmotivated.\r\n\r\nIt’s okay to want something, simply because you want to prove to\r\nyourself that you can get it.\r\n\r\n​Ready to get rich now?

No motion. And a Toyota Corolla.\r\n\r\nThat night, I chose the bong rip and pushed this existential\r\ncrisis to tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThat was a dangerous decision I made more times than I should’ve.\r\n\r\nBut luckily I snapped out of it.\r\n\r\nI’ve wrestled this tendency to drift for years.\r\n\r\nAnd I won just enough times to get me here.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my lesson for you today is this:\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to be perfect.\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to sacrifice everything.\r\n\r\nAnd you don’t even need a David Goggins poster on your wall.\r\n\r\nYou just need to notice when you’re misaligned – and have the\r\ncourage to do something about it.\r\n\r\nThose moments when you hear that voice inside – that’s a breaking\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIt first whispers, “this isn’t what you want. What are you\r\ndoing?”\r\n\r\nIgnore it long enough and it yells…\r\n\r\n“Wake the fuck up!”\r\n\r\nIf you hear that voice, you’re one of the lucky ones.\r\n\r\nYou haven’t let the world beat the light out of you yet.\r\n\r\nBut it’s up to you to follow it.\r\n\r\nSo here I am.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five, no chest hair, still spelling “restaurant” wrong.\r\n\r\nBut I’m grateful I listened to that voice in my head a few times\r\nmore than I ignored it.\r\n\r\nBecause those few decisions compounded into the life I get to\r\nlive now.\r\n\r\nIf you take anything from this ramble, let it be this:\r\n\r\nYour intuition is a compass.\r\n\r\nMost people bury it under weekends and half naked women on social\r\nmedia.\r\n\r\nIf you can keep yours alive and actually act on it…\r\n\r\nYou’ll end up somewhere worth being.\r\n\r\nHere’s to the next 9,131 days.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nP.S. This Wednesday at 7pm EST I’m running a free live training\r\nwhere I’ll show you how to use AI to land, operate, and scale\r\nwith info-product clients.\r\n\r\nInstead of stacking tiny retainers, you’ll learn how to close\r\nclients that can pay you $10k+/mo.\r\n\r\n​Register here.

    "body": "“You can easily go from zero to $10k/mo in 90 days!”\r\n\r\nBullshit.\r\n\r\nFor a complete beginner, there’s about a 90% chance it takes you\r\n6+ months –- no matter what business model you choose.\r\n\r\nThe 0-$10k/mo phase isn’t about finding the “right vehicle.”\r\n\r\nIt’s about upgrading from neanderthal to modern human.\r\n\r\nBefore $10k/mo you’re effectively a toddler.\r\n\r\nTo become a grown adult, you need new habits, new skills, and new\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nThat’s a lot of change to cram into 90 days.\r\n\r\nSorry to burst your bubble.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some outliers.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, someone will come into Artisan Lab and just\r\n“get it” right away.\r\n\r\nThe best way I can describe their mentality is this:\r\n\r\nThey accept the fact that they feel like they’re in over their\r\nhead but they refuse to let that stop them from taking action.\r\n\r\nObviously when you start something new there’s a lot you don’t\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to learn everything at once, get a baseline\r\nunderstanding as fast as possible…\r\n\r\nThen jump in the deep end.\r\n\r\nWhen you do that, you might just stumble your way into money a\r\nlot quicker than you thought.\r\n\r\nJust like Shaeis did:\r\n\r\n​\r\nHe joined Artisan Lab exactly 67(!) days ago. Yes, six seven.\r\n\r\nSince then, he hit his first $10k month.\r\n\r\nHe had zero previous experience.\r\n\r\nI wish I could take full credit for his success but I can’t.\r\n\r\nSure I gave him a roadmap…\r\n\r\n5 weekly coaching calls.\r\n\r\nCountless hours of course content.\r\n\r\n1-1 support, a community full of winners, and everything he could\r\npossibly need to hit $10k/mo as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nBut he was the one who executed.\r\n\r\nI can’t take credit for that.\r\n\r\nThe 90-day $10k promise is highly unlikely.\r\n\r\nBut Shaeis proved it can happen.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t wait until he felt ready.\r\n\r\nHe got in the game, took consistent action, and figured it out.\r\n\r\nThat’s the difference.\r\n\r\nIf you want a shot at being one of those rare outliers, you can\r\njoin us here.

New York is 1-4.\r\n\r\nThe New York Giants haven't won a Thursday night football game in\r\nTEN years…\r\n\r\nUntil last night.\r\n\r\nNot only did they win…\r\n\r\nBut they won by 17 points.\r\n\r\nSeven. Teen.\r\n\r\nAnd once again, I lost money.\r\n\r\nSports betting and business are similar in some ways.\r\n\r\nYou risk your dollars to hopefully get more dollars in return.\r\n\r\nIf you can predictably turn just $1 into $2 at scale, you’ll soon\r\nbe rich.\r\n\r\nMy goal with the people who invest into Artisan Lab is to do\r\nexactly that.\r\n\r\nThey give me their hard-earned money and I help them turn it into\r\nmuch more.\r\n\r\nApparently it’s working a little too well…\r\n\r\nI got this message from Lorenzo the other day:\r\n\r\n​\r\nHe paid me and then told me I undercharged him.\r\n\r\nAnd that was before a recent addition:\r\n\r\nSanjay, who manages roughly $1M/month in ad spend, just joined as\r\nour newest coach.\r\n\r\nWe now have coaching calls every weekday…\r\n\r\nAnd by next week, Sanjay will have finished a brand-new paid ads\r\ncourse that’s being added to the program.\r\n\r\nSo, a week from today -- October 17th at 11:59PM EST -- the price\r\nis officially going up.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been waiting for a sign, this is it.

His assistant answers.\r\n\r\nI can’t remember exactly what we said but it was something along\r\nthe lines of:\r\n\r\n“Hey we’re not actually interested in buying jewelry from you but\r\nwe saw you’re starting coaching. We run marketing and operations\r\nfor info-product businesses.”\r\n\r\nSomewhat surprisingly, it went well.\r\n\r\nThe assistant told us they were looking for someone to help.\r\n\r\nA few hours later we got on zoom with the assistant and the main\r\npersonal brand guy.\r\n\r\nWe pitched him on building out the whole launch.\r\n\r\nSales page, webinar, backend tech and set up.\r\n\r\n$15k plus 10% of cash collected.\r\n\r\nHe says yes – but we only get paid (including the set up fee)\r\nonce everything's built out.\r\n\r\nLet’s do it. If we get scammed at least it’ll make a good story.\r\n\r\nWe sprint to build everything.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later it’s launch day.\r\n\r\nWe make $50k from one post and a couple emails.\r\n\r\nAnother $100k over the next few days.\r\n\r\nAnd just like that, a $30,300 wire was sent to my bank account.\r\n\r\n22 days from the time we cold called him to the time we got paid.\r\n\r\nThat’s fast money.\r\n\r\nWill that happen for you?\r\n\r\nProbably not. At least not right away.\r\n\r\nBut the only reason it could happen for me was because I’d found\r\nthe right vehicle – the same one that allowed:\r\n\r\nYahya to make $75k in a single month from his first client.\r\n\r\nKhesraw to go from $500/mo with 10 clients to $30k/mo from one\r\n(while living in Afghanistan).\r\n\r\nKareem, who hit $36k/mo in three months.\r\n\r\nYou can join the winning team here… (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u0kgn5wzhvhx63pvqf6h62qxkggclh72vgw/3ohphkh330zq0dhr/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n)\r\n\r\nOr wait until the price increases tomorrow night at 11:59pm.\r\n\r\nUp to you :)\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u0kgn5wzhvhx63pvqf6h62qxkggclh72vgw\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u0kgn5wzhvhx63pvqf6h62qxkggclh72vgw\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

Then $50k/mo.\r\n\r\nAnd now six-figure profit months, consistently.\r\n\r\nThese are just a few of the dozens of wins inside.\r\n\r\nIf you’re on the fence, hopefully they give you the conviction to\r\ntake the leap.\r\n\r\nYou have until tonight at midnight before the price goes up.\r\n\r\nApply and book a call (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vukr0nl6oh9h9g2l45ilhv0egk55snhxm59l/l2hehmhll2ez4wf6/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vdGhlLWFydGlzYW4tbGFi\r\n) before then to lock in the current rate.\r\n\r\nOr click here (\r\nhttps://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vukr0nl6oh9h9g2l45ilhv0egk55snhxm59l/m2h7h5h335v792tm/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5iZW5iYWRlci5jb20vcHJvb2YxNzYwNjMyNzcyMjAw\r\n) to see what’s inside and join directly.\r\n\r\nSocial proof, social proof, social proof.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n​\r\n​\r\n\r\n​Unsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.convertkit-mail2.com/0vukr0nl6oh9h9g2l45ilhv0egk55snhxm59l\r\n) | Update your profile (\r\nhttps://preferences.convertkit-mail2.com/0vukr0nl6oh9h9g2l45ilhv0egk55snhxm59l\r\n) | 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Ste 204, Miami, FL 33137",

I lasted about 5x longer.\r\n\r\nThe only problem was 4 multiplied by 5 is still only 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis pissed me off.\r\n\r\nI used to sit in that damn tub for 10-15 minutes without\r\nflinching.\r\n\r\nSo for the next half hour, I went back and forth between the two.\r\n\r\nI could only last about a minute in the cold.\r\n\r\nEach time, I thought I’d be fine once the first 30-second shock\r\nwore off\r\n\r\nEach time, I was wrong.\r\n\r\nAlright, one more attempt…\r\n\r\nI submerged into the frigid water telling myself:\r\n\r\n“You’ve done this before.”\r\n\r\n“The pain will subside, just breathe.”\r\n\r\n“If you get out you’re gay.”\r\n\r\nThat last one really got me.\r\n\r\nA minute in, I’m fine.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes in, still chillin.\r\n\r\nThree minutes in, it feels like a hot tub.\r\n\r\nI stayed in that bitch ass water for the next five minutes.\r\n\r\nNow, I know you’re thinking, “wowwww Ben you’re so fucking sick\r\ndude!”\r\n\r\nThank you, b.\r\n\r\nHere’s the real reason I’ve told you this silly little story:\r\n\r\nI only accomplished the goal because I knew I could.\r\n\r\nI’d done it before – meaning I had previous data indicating it\r\nwas possible.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I was so stubborn.\r\n\r\nI didn’t want to fail at something that I knew I could do.\r\n\r\nSo my question for you is:\r\n\r\nIf you knew that you couldn’t fail, would you ever quit?\r\n\r\nProbably not, right?\r\n\r\nYour success is guaranteed.\r\n\r\nIt might take three months.\r\n\r\nIt might take a year.\r\n\r\nIt might take five years.\r\n\r\nBut if you just keep getting back in that cold ass water…\r\n\r\nEventually it’ll feel normal.\r\n\r\nPeople just like you have done it – it’s your turn.

We’re gonna make millions together.”\r\n\r\nThen you realize, “ohhhh, there are a lot of problems we’ll have\r\nto fix first.”\r\n\r\nBut here’s the good news:\r\n\r\nJoe is doing everything right.\r\n\r\nHe’s closing solid clients who are able to pay him setup fees.\r\n\r\n(which is important because it means he’s not working with broke\r\nretards).\r\n\r\nHe’s inches away from a big win – as long as he doesn’t get\r\ndistracted.\r\n\r\nHere’s what I told him:\r\n\r\n1. Maximize everything you can with your current clients.\r\n\r\nGo above and beyond to get the best results possible.\r\n\r\nYour goal right now is to find the winners you can scale with\r\nlong term.\r\n\r\n2. Keep doing what you’re doing on outreach.\r\n\r\nDon’t stop getting new clients until you have clear winners.\r\n\r\n3. Be aggressive – but patient.\r\n\r\nBy that I mean understand you’re the epitome of that three feet\r\nfrom gold meme.\r\n\r\nYou’re swinging the hammer over and over.\r\n\r\nYou know the gold has to be back there somewhere.\r\n\r\nBut you don’t know which swing will be the breaking point.\r\n\r\nThe only thing you can control is how aggressive you swing.\r\n\r\nSo if you’re in a similar spot to Joe...\r\n\r\nYou’re working hard, doing the right things, but getting a bit\r\ndiscouraged…\r\n\r\nYou’re probably a lot closer than you think.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to change what’s working -- you need to double\r\ndown until the dam breaks.\r\n\r\nHere’s what happens then:\r\n\r\n​\r\nJust keep going.\r\n\r\nAnd if you want my personal help making the image above your\r\nreality – go here.
