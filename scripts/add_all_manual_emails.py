You really think I'm that dumb?

Come on.

I bet you're like "WTF did I just subscribe to?"

This kid has an email list and he doesn't even know how to personalize emails???

For the record Adam I do know how to personalize these things I just wanted to grab your attention.

So listen my friend.

I don't know when, why, or how you subscribed to this...

... and I don't know how often I'll be emailing you.

Every now and then I'll drink too much caffeine and spam your inbox at 1am, but most of the time you'll forget I even exist.

This is the part where I tell you to look out for my next email titled "my story" (intentionally in all lowercase so it's more *trendy*).

But fortunately for you, I won't be assaulting your inbox with a boring welcome series over the next 3 days.

You're welcome.

I will be sending you direct mail though.

You will receive a letter in the mail tomorrow titled "IRS: YOU'RE BEING AUDITED"

So if you don't mind just open that, write down your bank info and SSN on a handy dandy napkin and mail it back to me.

Thanks.

Sent from my Xbox 360.

    ("2/20/2023", "i got you breakfast Adam", """It's 10:11 am, and I just sat down inside my favorite coffee spot in Miami.

The sweet lady who takes my order every day seemed kind of sad, so I bought her an iced latte.

I wasn't planning on writing an email to you right now, but it's a good excuse to postpone my long list of to-dos for the day.

There's a couple to my left, and this woman literally spent 4 minutes taking pictures of her acai bowl before she started eating it.

I know it was 4 minutes because I've been staring at my screen for the same amount of time, trying to decide where to take this email.

Yesterday I posted an Instagram pic, and someone commented, "need to obtain this lifestyle."

It's interesting how that works. Remember when you were chasing what you have right now?

But now it just feels so normal… there was no mystical point of arrival.

Before I turn this into some corny "be grateful" type email, the couple next to me got like 4 different entrees, and shorty just got up to order more.

Breakfast is a scam. Anyone that claims to be hungry before noon literally just has no self-control. They're just bored and would rather get up and waddle to the local woofery rather than do anything productive with their lives.

If you're reading this while taking a bite of your warm little pancake breakfast at 11 am, spit it out. And unsubscribe. You're not welcome here.

You can have coffee before noon. That's it.

Seriously fasting will help your focus so much. We've all been psyop'd by big breakfast into believing that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and it's simply not true.

I think fat people should have to pay extra taxes too.

Oh my god, this bitch to the left is taking more pictures of their FIFTH entree.

Sorry, I'm gonna kill someone.

Imagine one day I'm running some really big public company, and someone just screenshots the last few lines of this email.

[CEO says, "fat people should pay extra taxes."] What a headline.

Ok, I've gotta get to work. I know this was schizo as fuck, so hopefully, I at least made you giggle on this beautiful Monday morning.

Have a great day (unless you ate breakfast),

    ("2/24/2023", "the most important questions of your life", """Good morning Adam,

Have you ever wondered why there's a space between good and morning but no space in goodnight?

Me too.

Just another piece of mind-controlling government propaganda we've all been sold (lol).

If I see one more person using "the matrix is attacking" angle to sell some bullshit course, I think I'm gonna implode.

"The economy is collapsing! Your job doesn't care about you! The government is trying to kill you…

Aaaand if you want to protect yourself from these things, you need to build a social circle! Pick up my program, How to stop being a bubble-blowing clown-loving burger-flipping idiot loser, today."

Moving on…

I've been thinking about how all stages of our lives eventually become mostly-happy memories.

Even the darker stages.

When I look back on times when I was super stressed out or down bad, it's with nothing but gratitude.

The word gratitude has become so corny, but I can't think of a synonym, so you're gonna have to bear with me.

The things that once brought me turbulence all seem so minuscule now.

I encourage you to audit your life as well.

Most people just sleepwalk through this whole thing.

Pause to analyze the things that you're stressing about and understand that all things are temporary. Good or bad.

You'll probably look back at this period in your life with amusement for the person you once were and appreciation for who you've become.

I'm doing this right now.

A few moments ago, I had to google whether it was "bare with me" or "bear with me."

Apparently, it was the latter.

Now I know… silly old me.

Speaking of silliness…

A handful of my friends around my same age have gotten married, and some even popped out a kid or two.

In no way am I hating on them, but this is just an absolute mindfuck to me.

Like how are you possibly mature enough to know you want to spend the rest of your life with a 20ish-year-old girl?

What if she gets a wrinkle? Or clogs your toilet? Or even worse… you discover she likes pineapple on her pizza???

Maybe I'm missing something, but these are all dealbreakers for me.

And I don't think I'm anywhere close enough to figuring out this life thing the way I'd want to in order to feel ready to share a bed with someone for the rest of time.

I could be immature. Idk man.

If you're still here, hit reply and lmk what you think. How does one decide they're ready to get married and have kids?

And if girls don't poop, why do they spend so much time in the bathroom?

The world may never know.

    ("3/6/2023", "get high with Jordan Peterson", """Yo Adam,

Happy Monday.

Yesterday I figured out how to add an auto-plug tweet that drops my newsletter link and got a bunch of new subscribers.

So if you're new here, welcome Adam. Pleasure to have you.

I'll fill you in real quick.

On November 10th, 2022, I set out to write a daily email to my subscribers for 100 days straight.

Today marks day 116 in a row.

Crazy right?

I've written an email every day for the last 116 days, which is even more than I originally set out to do. You should feel horrible about yourself.

Only the thing is, today is day 14.

I took a long hiatus after day 9 and have been writing a few emails a week for the last week or so. Consider me your fun uncle. Sometimes I disappear for while but when I'm around it's a great time.

Now that you're all caught up let's get down to business…

In college, I used to take chops a few nights a week.

If you don't know what a chop is, it's when you put weed and tobacco in a bong and clear it in one hit.

It's the craziest head rush a few dollars worth of weed and a fifth of a light blue American Spirit can buy.

The thing about chops is they're not entirely pleasant.

You usually start spinning and feel like you're gonna throw up. Or you end up drooling all over yourself.

But if you can get over that phase, the buzz is completely and utterly unmatched.

Imagine all of the lights in your brain just shutting off for a fleeting moment. It's like you transport into the mind of a 20-year-old blonde sorority girl.

I'm telling you this because chops offer a perfect analogy for life.

The lows allow you to appreciate the highs (literally).

Look at child celebrities and kids that made it big in crypto.

Most of them go insane because they were handed everything too quickly. I'm sure it's fun at the beginning, where you're just able to fuck off for a bit.

But what happens when that kind of stuff gets old?

Surely nothing can give you the same kind of dopamine high that you get when you turn $1,000 into $10m on some meme coin of a dog.

Right?

Maybe I'm just jealous.

Anyway, I gotta go scam little kids on the internet.

Hit reply if you're new here, and tell me your favorite color or something.

Talk soon,

Ben"""),

    ("3/15/2023", "don't open", """It's 12:21am in Brickell and I feel like a fool.

Business is good. Deals are happening like crazy, should be another record month, have a clear path to $100k per month.

But that's not why we're here. All that stuff is silly in the end.

Life is meant to be lived. It's the most beautiful gift any of us will ever get. But most of us miss all of it.

Including the entrepreneurs and the people that "escape the rat race."

We make our own rat race.

We're constantly chasing the next arbitrary number that doesn't mean anything in the end.

I was in the shower thinking about what I'd do if someone gave me $100m today.

The thought of that scares me.

It'll scare you too if you pause and think about it. Right now you occupy your time with stuff that you pretend matters so you live a life that doesn't feel pointless.

But,

What you stress about is meaningless.

And so is anything you accomplish.

Here's why:

Let's say you solve the money problem.

You wake up tomorrow, refresh your banking app, and 100 million dollars are in your savings account.

You now have the biggest problem you've ever had in your entire life.

You have to figure out what you really want.

I'm writing to you because my 3 year old dog, Tucker got diagnosed with a kidney disease today and he has around a year to live.

This all made me think about how everyones clock is ticking. One day, everyone I love and everyone you love will be gone.

As bad as it sounds, imagine if that's one of your (human) family members.

Everything you're working on or stressing about, all becomes white noise.

And now you feel like an idiot for neglecting some relationships in order to get the next dopamine hit.

If we spend all our time chasing these numbers on a screen…

We'll miss the entire time that the people (and dogs) we loved were here.

Which is the point of it all.

When my loved ones die, I don't want to feel like I left anything on the table...

If you're still reading I'm glad you've joined me for todays spiritual enlightenment. I swear I'm usually not this doom and gloom.

Normally I'll just write some funny schizophrenic email and then forget I have an email list for a few weeks.

This was actually just gonna be a journal to myself, never to be published on the world-wide web.

But for some reason I half-way want to share it so I'm scheduling it to send at 1:04am so no one reads it.

Including you, Adam.

Goodnight… love you no homo,

Ben"""),

    ("4/3/2023", "i'm still alive", """I missed you Adam.

A lot has changed since we last spoke.

For starters I rearranged my desk, got a new rug, started drinking black coffee, and had a baby.

One of the things in the sentence may not be true and I'll leave it to you to discern which one.

I've been trying to be more in tune with the voice in the back of my head that never shuts up and it's been telling me to make more content.

So that's why we're here.

One thing I miss about being in a college town and not knowing as many people in the online marketing space is that it was easier to make my own decisions.

You have far fewer inputs from various people,

It's just you and your gut instinct.

A couple years ago, my gut instinct told me to build a marketing agency working with basketball trainers.

In hindsight it was a dumb decision.

Most of them didn't have much money and it was hard to get results for them.

But that "fuck up" equipped me with the tools to build my next business to over $50k a month.

When you listen to others and are always trying to make the "perfect" decision it robs you of the lessons you may have learned by following your intuition and having to take a longer route.

It's almost as if you know deep down the route that you're supposed to be on in order to become the type of person that you're destined to be.

And the thing is, that route is not the smooth one.

It's bumpy, there's ups, there's downs, and every now and then you hit a tree and run over a fat person.

Figuratively

I originally got into this space because I wanted to be a content creator.

There were a dozen people I looked up to on social media and their lives looked incredible so naturally I wanted that for myself.

But I needed something to talk about.

And I thought that building a business would give me the life experience I needed to become someone worth listening to.

So I built my first biz and told myself I'll start making content when I was making $10k a month… then $20k a month… then $30k and so on.

But at each milestone I'd come up with some new arbitrary destination for when I had enough "authority" to share a message with the world.

You may be doing something like this too.

You think to yourself "I'll be happy when this happens, I'll be less anxious when I just accomplish XYZ."

But you're gonna reach that goal Adam.

And when you do, you'll be the same damn person you were before you got there.

Your inner dialogue will be the same.

Your self image won't change much.

And you'll be stuck, looking at the (wo)man you are in the mirror wondering why you don't feel the way you anticipated you would when you set out on this journey.

Only then will you realize that you'll only ever have yourself; a self that never changes.

A connection to something that's greater than you… and it simply wants peace.

It doesn't care about what you accomplish, how much money is in your bank account, how many girls you have in your DM's.

It's not playing the status game.

Because somewhere in there, buried underneath all of the armor you've built above it…

… it won't change.

Listen to that voice.

And find peace with the person you are today. If you're still here reading and any of this made sense to you, hit 'reply' and let me know because I thrive off of your validation.

Anyway, I ate an edible 39 minutes ago and it seems as though it's starting to hit me.

In order to maintain the legibility and keep the schizophrenia levels to a minimum on this email, I'm gonna end it here.

Goodnight Adam,

Ben"""),

    ("4/4/2023", "what was your day like", """Hey Adam, how was your day?

Mine was good too.

When I was in the shower earlier I realized that the thousand dollar Herman Miller chair I'm sitting in right now was kind of a scam.

Sure it's kinda comfy.

It looks okay.

But the only reason people rave about these chairs is because they're expensive and other people like them.

So I got placeboo'd into liking it too because I didn't want to be the odd one out.

Oops.

Anyway, any chance you're an accountant Adam?

I've been needing to submit a bunch of income statements and other docs to one of the 2 accountants I've been leading on during this tax season.

But I really don't feel like doing it, so it's sat on my daily to-do list every day for the last 3 months.

Maybe I can just opt out???

Guess we'll find out.

Switching gears again - you know you're growing when you're able to look back at yourself 3-6 months ago and you kind of cringe.

You think about how naive you were, how you were less confident, and the silly things you might've been stressing about.

Over the weekend I was back in the city I went to college in.

When I'd ask people what's new in their life, nearly all of their responses would go as follows:

"Not too much man… same old. Kind of tired of doing the same thing everyday and I'm ready to get out of here."

Many of my friends are about to graduate.

They think the new experience of getting a job and moving to a different city will paint their life with excitement.

And it might for a little bit.

But in a couple years that new routine and new city will once again become mundane and they'll tell themself the same old lie that they just need to change their environment.

They refuse to ever consider the possibility that the circumstances are not the problem.

They are the problem.

You're probably the problem in your own life too.

I know I am.

I was addicted to basketball from the age of 9 to 17.

I was sneaking into the gym to workout, always watching film, I even bought a mental performance course from a guy named Taylor Allan.

But all that work I put in never really showed in games.

I was a decent player, I started my junior and senior seasons in high school, but I never dominated the way I knew I could've.

And there was always an excuse.

My coach wouldn't let me play the way I wanted, my teammates didn't work together, my shoes felt weird, I was hungry, the defender kept grabbing me, etc…

There's one constant variable here and it was me.

I was the problem.

I couldn't get out of my own head and just play.

Most of what you want lies on the other side of getting out of your own way.

Stop blaming anything and everything that you're not where you want to be.

And don't buy a Herman Miller chair just because your favorite guru has one.

Love you,

Ben"""),

    ("4/5/2023", "you have more to say than you think you do", """Your story is unique. That's what makes it interesting.

You think people don't care, and to an extent - most don't.

But there's always gonna be a pocket of people that resonate with your message.

Not because it's so much better than any of the other people they can listen to online.

But because it's you saying it.

Through your own lens you've experienced the world in a way that is different from everyone else.

I used to neglect my journey because I've never been through anything incredibly difficult, relative to others.

I was never in poverty.

I didn't watch my parents struggle.

And I've always had a safety net.

If I wanted to, I could've followed the traditional route and lived a decent life.

But that's not what the 10 year old version of myself wanted… that younger version had the intuition to know that together, we were capable of more.

And while most are able to quiet that undying ball of light inside them, I never could.

Believe me I tried.

So much so that I hacked the "perfect" rich kid life.

College was paid for so I chose a school with a 70% female population, joined a frat, and convinced myself that it was all okay.

I was gonna coast through my 4 years of fun - although it might've taken an extra year or two at the rate I was at.

Then collect my degree and go off and live a comfortable life.

But the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.

And thankfully, an olive branch was offered to me so I took it.

In 2020, right before the pandemic I went through a breakup.

I could write a page on the series of events that lead up to that breakup, but to refrain from boring you all I can point to is divine intervention.

Everything worked out too horribly; and too perfectly not to be planned.

One thing led to another and next thing you know I was alone; trying to figure out how to make money again.

When I was younger I'd toyed around in various online business models only to find little success.

But once I was in college enjoying the frat life, all of that stopped.

About 3 years later I'm sitting in my Miami high rise on a Wednesday night, writing to you.

My business is coming off back to back record months, each of which I've made more money than I probably would've made in an entire year with a job out of college.

But I'm not writing this to brag about my accomplishments or paint myself in the light of someone who's "made it."

I don't know if anyone ever truly makes it.

I do know that I'm incredibly lucky to be in the situation I'm in and I'd feel as though I'm doing an injustice to the world by not sharing tidbits of the lessons I've learned along the way.

Furthermore it'd be an injustice to myself.

We all want to feel heard.

We want to feel understood.

And we want to feel important.

But this isn't validation that you can find outside of yourself.

You'll look for it and come up empty handed.

Truthfully, no one really cares about you.

They care about themselves.

So one of the best things you can do for someone - and what they truly want is for you to teach them lessons that you wish you would've known when you were in their position.

And before you know it you'll impact thousands of people in ways that you couldn't have imagined.

Maybe that's where you'll find the fulfillment you're looking for.

Some bad habits just seem to only have positive effects.

At least in the short term that is.

Lana Del Ray is humming in the background as I sit here looking at a blank page, buzzing like a bee from the nicotine pouch cutting into my mouth ever so slightly.

Is this heaven?

There's a story about a girl who went through severe brain trauma and upon waking up couldn't remember anything.

Not her name.

Not her personality.

And none of her family members or friends.

For the sake of the story let's call her Sarah.

When her mom came into the hospital room, Sarah asked her to describe her personality.

Sarah's mom described her as sweet, a little shy, genuine and wouldn't hurt a fly.

Not too long after, her boyfriend came in. She asked him the same question.

He told her how exuberant she is. How she lights up a room. And how she's never afraid to speak her mind.

She prodded a little more by asking him what things that he doesn't like about her.

He told her that she has questionable decision making when it comes to her friends… and that the reason she was in the hospital is because a few of her friends got in a fight, she ended up in the middle of it and hit her head on the concrete.

The next day another one of her friends walks in. She describes Sarah as loud and crazy. She says that Sarah is hilarious but sometimes doesn't know when to stop and that's why the fight started. She goes on to tell Sarah that she instigated the fight and describes the sequence of events leading up to it.

How can this be?

All 3 descriptions that she's received sound like they could be 3 completely different people.

She wonders who is lying to her and why. But What Sarah doesn't realize is that each persons' reality is colored by their perception, made up of their own unique previous experiences.

Hence the disconnect.

In their minds they weren't lying.

Think the same concept holds true in your life?

Does your mom know the same version of you that your friends do?

Maybe. Maybe not.

Truthfully when I read this, I didn't really know what to make of it.

My best attempt at describing the message of this story would be something along the lines of…

Stop caring so much about what other people think about you. Their opinion is more so a reflection of them than it is an all-encompassing description of you.

You know who you are when you're alone. Bring out that true authentic version of yourself no matter who you're around – within reason.

The best person you can be is you. Because that's what separates you from everyone else.

Something to think about.

Chat tomorrow Adam… if that's even your real name.

Ben"""),

    ("4/9/2023", "is everything we believe a lie?", """There comes a point in your life where you realize your parents are human.

For many of us, when you're growing up it's easy to think your parents can do no wrong.

Their word is like the word of God himself.

This is the frame in which you see the world for most of your childhood.

It probably never ends for some.

But the inevitable truth that you may come to realize is – they're human.

They fuck up.

They have flaws that are likely passed down to you.

And they don't always know what's best for you the way you do.

It's not their fault.

The same thing happened to them and every generation of your family before them.

It's a freeing yet terrifying conclusion to draw.

It may shatter your world view and make you begin to question everything.

Who can you really trust?

Who's fundamentally flawed beliefs have you almost unconsciously been subscribed to?

Some recent events in my life have brought me to this very position and I feel somewhat lost because of it.

I've never been one to blindly follow the paradigm of others and have lived by my own rules for a while.

But still I can't seem to shake this feeling that some of the people I've looked up to in my life might not be who I thought they were.

This leads me back to what seems to be an ongoing theme in this newsletter…

We all perceive the world through a lens that is 100% unique to us.

If we don't build our own values and our own belief system, one will be placed upon us.

And this is one that we don't have any control over.

It's a jaded perception of reality that was adopted by someone else who's had a completely different set of experiences than we've had.

The embodiment of a reality that is truly up to us is freeing and scary.

But if you don't eventually come to this conclusion on your own and live by it; it'll happen on its own.

And this is a level of freedom that you might not be prepared for if you haven't started to realize it on your own.

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong.

    ("4/11/2023", "what makes someone interesting?", """I've got a quicker one for you today so if you've been opening my emails and skipping till the end – try giving this one a read.

There are periods in your life where it makes sense to optimize for more experiences rather than more money.

Yes, you need money.

And it will likely be a top priority for the majority of your life.

But the most interesting people are not the richest people in the world.

I don't want to be the next Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos.

No one looks up to the guys that have perfectly optimized their sleep schedule and flex their Oura ring number like it's a trophy.

We look up to the people that have seemingly lived a thousand lives.

They've experienced the highs, lows, and everything in between in a plethora of various realms.

Even the wealthiest people are not interesting just because they made a ton of money.

People like Matthew McConaughey or Richard Branson could entertain a room without ever talking about business.

Their experiences outside of the accumulation of wealth make them interesting.

When I first moved to Miami in September of 2022, my first priority was to make more money.

I'm now in a position where I'm making the money I wanted, but I'm not doing the things I imagined I would at this point.

If I continued on this current trajectory eventually I'd become a robot.

I'll hit $100k a month and be jealous of the guy making $10k a month who has his community on lock.

He can't go anywhere without running into a handful of people he knows.

He doesn't wait in lines.

He has all of the girls and status that would make you think he's the one that's balling financially.

And isn't that everything that you think of when you imagine the future version of yourself that's making the money you want to make?

You don't fantasize about refreshing your banking app and seeing a number the equivalent length of a phone number.

You fantasize about everything that supposedly comes with that.

Don't forget that when you reach the point that you're aiming for financially right now.

    ("4/18/2023", "if schizophrenia was an email", """Yo Adam.

Apologies for the radio silence the past few days.

I was babysitting a lost puppy that I found on the internet and then went to a mastermind where my mentor yelled at me for being poor.

Did you know there is a girl that's made like $8m selling gnomes on the internet?

And 2 other chicks that are probably making more money than all of us combined selling bath water and jars of farts with a rose in them?

AND the "catch me outside" girl has made nearly $50 MILLION in the last 2 years on only fans?!

Now ya know.

These are some things I learned at my mastermind.

Anyway Adam I've been reading the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear.

Biggest takeaways through 10 chapters:

We are the amalgamation of a bunch of small habits added up over time.

The best way to add a new habit is to make it enjoyable and easy to execute on.

Create triggers that remind you to perform the new habit and it becomes easy.

Most things that aren't scheduled on a clear day with a clear time do not end up happening. All of my goals are lagging indicators of my small daily habits.

Also, I get through books way quicker when I listen to the audio along with it. I think I'm semi-retarded.

I've been boxing a lot recently. Do you think if someone hits me hard enough it'll balance out the schizophrenia?

Learning a combat sport will "put some hair on your chest" as every 50 something year old white dad likes to say.

You know that list of a few things you have in the back of your head that you're scared of but you know you're gonna have to do at some point in order to stop feeling like a little bitch?

Boxing was one of those for me and it feels great to be finally doing it.

There's a good book on this called either "the war of art" or "the art of war". One of those is about actual war and the other is about internal resistance - I'm referring to the latter but can't remember which title is which.

Did you miss the more manic, somewhat illegible style of emails? I know I did.
